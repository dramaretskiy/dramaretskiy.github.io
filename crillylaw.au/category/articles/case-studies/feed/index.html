				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us at some point know someone that has told us about illegally downloading a movie via an internet site. It seems unfair for those of us who pay full price through iTunes but most of us just figure that the younger generation are smarter than us.</p>
<p>A new Federal Court case sheds some light on the rights of the movie makers as owners of the copyright and those pesky downloaders. What happens when they get caught and how do they get caught?</p>
<p>It seems from the evidence in the Dallas Buyers Club Movie (DBC) and a group of Internet Service Providers (ISP), including IINet, Internode and Dodo, that the fight continues. On 14 August the Federal Court gave an indication of the compensation copyright owners can expect to claim in future copyright breach matters and how the illegal downloaders might expect to receive a bill.</p>
<p>What happened here was a digital investigator found 4,726 IP Addresses from which the DBC movie was illegally downloaded and shared on &#8220;Bit Torrent&#8221;. The owner sought a Court Order requiring the relevant ISP to provide details of the owners of the IP Addresses.</p>
<p>To get an Order like this they had to demonstrate a right to obtain relief against potential Defendants, namely the ISP account holders. The judge ordered the ISP to provide this information but DBC had to provide the letter of demand to the account holders. The concern here was an unreasonable demand for the level of damages suffered from the copyright infringement.</p>
<p>In terms of the amount of money the owner of the copyright intended to claim, the letters set out four things:-</p>
<ol>
<li>A claim for the cost of downloading a film;</li>
<li>A claim relating to the uploading or sharing of the film on Bit Torrent;</li>
<li>A claim relating to additional damages because of repeat infringing;</li>
<li>A claim for part of the costs of proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The general principle is that damages must put the party who has had their rights breached, in the same position it would have been in, had the infringement never occurred.</p>
<p>The judge found that a claim relating to the cost of downloading the film and a claim for a proportionate part of the cost of proceedings was permissible. However the Court found that a claim relating to the uploading or sharing of the film on Bit Torrent and additional damages due to potential repeat infringements was not.</p>
<p>I learnt that a user downloads slivers of a movie file from many other uses, and the slivers are then put together to form the full movie. By doing this Bit Torrent automatically shares and uploads the slivers of the file to each of the other downloaders. It must be a Gen Y thing!</p>
<p>The owners of the copyright claim that each sliver shared was actionable. This meant they would have been charged for sharing the film on the internet at full price for each sliver. The Court found this was not permissible even though it was clearly designed to act as a deterrent to the illegal downloading.</p>
<p>The Court also found additional damages could be claimed when taking into account all the other relevant matters including downloaders history on Bit Torrent so that the more they downloaded, the higher the additional damages should be. The Court found that this approach by the copyright owner was not reasonable and it came back to the cost of hiring the film by download and a proportionate part of the cost of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The Court said they would only allow access to the identities of the downloaders if DBC undertook to make a claim for the cost of download of the movie and proportionate part of the proceedings only. The Court required the foreign based owner of the copyright to pay a bond of $600,000.00 to the Court which would be lost if they failed to follow the undertakings. Heavy stuff!</p>
<p>So the general principles to be derived are:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal downloaders can be pursued by virtue of the ISP; and</li>
<li>Reasonable damages will be awarded as well as a proportionate part of the cost of the action of the breach, but no more.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tricky situation for an owner of a copyright is, will the costs of proceedings and pursuing the illegal downloaders and recovering small amount of damages be cost effective and enough of a deterrent. It certainly makes you think very carefully about how technology is disrupting the traditional framework of access to material, rights to exercise over the cost of sharing copyright material and whether any potential claims are adequate deterrent from doing it.</p>
<p>Owners of copyright of should think very carefully about how it is shared by the internet. Call us if you would like to discuss your copyright issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crillylaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Email_Subject_Lines.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1724" src="http://crillylaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Email_Subject_Lines.jpg" alt="Email_Subject_Lines" width="678" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>It is a surprise to many of our clients that the exchange of emails can constitute a binding Contract. The courts are frequently holding people to these Contracts and it is a topic that requires some careful consideration in times where email is the dominant method of communication. Stodgy old paper Agreements with a lengthy witnessing clause might get left on the desk when parties are talking. However, if there is sufficient dialogue and certainty of terms by email, that may be enough to create a legally binding agreement.</p>
<p>When parties are negotiating it is a real danger time and there are some rules that should be followed during those exchanges.</p>
<p>Although the Courts are often perceived as being backwards in regards to technology, they have in fact responded to this shift in communication by accepting email as a means of creating binding agreements.</p>
<p>Not all business managers have caught up with this trend and are regularly placing their company at risk.  It is a mistake to believe that what is said or agreed over email is not binding, and that a legally binding contract is only made when a formal written document is signed.</p>
<p>Take a look at some recent cases with us and let us know if you have a similar issue in your business.</p>
<p><strong>EMAIL NEGOTIATIONS – BINDING OR NOT?</strong></p>
<p>If you have started to negotiate by email but don&#8217;t want your emails to be a binding contract, then you must clearly state in your emails that “<em>no binding agreement is formed unless and until a formal contract has been executed</em>”.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t expressly state this condition, a Court is unlikely to read it that implied in your emails, is the intention to be legally bound.</p>
<p>In May this year, the Queensland Supreme Court held in <em>Stellard Pty Ltd v North Queensland Fuel Pty Ltd</em><sup>1</sup> that a binding contract for the sale of land had been made by email. Amazingly, both the offer email and the email accepting the offer referred to the offer being &#8220;<em>subject to contract</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>subject to execution</em>&#8220;. This was not enough to make the offer conditional apparently.</p>
<p>Following the email exchange, the buyer sent a contract to the seller for execution but it was not signed. The seller later withdrew from the deal and entered into a contract with a third party. This is where the problem started as the buyer had understood the deal to be done.</p>
<p>The Court found that within the broader context of the emails, the parties had intended to be bound immediately. This was the case, even though the parties expected to substitute the agreement with a formal contract containing additional terms. Essentially the guts of the deal had been agreed to and were not able to be refuted.</p>
<p>The Court was also satisfied that the emails met the requirement that a contract for the sale of land be in writing and signed, applying the <em>Electronic Transactions (Queensland) Act 2001</em>(Qld).</p>
<p>The Stellard decision was very similar to an earlier decision this year by the Western Australian Court of Appeal in <em>Vantage Systems Pty Ltd v Priolo Corporation Pty Ltd</em><sup>2</sup>. In this case, it was held that a binding contract to lease commercial premises had been made by a series of emails, despite the emails referring to the offer as being &#8220;<em>subject to formal approval</em>&#8220;. You can see the problem and the pattern here.</p>
<p>In its decision, the Court was not influenced by the fact that the parties could not agree on a reinstatement clause and that no formal lease was ever signed despite the parties&#8217; intentions to do so.</p>
<p>The &#8216;binding email&#8217; trend extends to settlement negotiations between lawyers by email.</p>
<p>In late June, the NSW Supreme Court found a binding settlement agreement had been made by email between lawyers in <em>Universal Music Australia Pty Limited v Pavlovic</em><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The Court held that the lawyer&#8217;s email stating that the client would sign the settlement deed, combined with the rest of the communications and conduct, was enough to create a binding contract. Whoops! It is a very old practice to ensure that you state “this offer is subject to final instructions from our client” just to cover your backside.</p>
<p>Although it was intended that a deed would be signed (and it never was), the Court refused to imply from the emails that no binding agreement would be created until the deed was actually signed.</p>
<p><strong>THE SEDUCING BY EMAIL</strong></p>
<p>The speed and casual ease with which emails can be written and exchanged is their attraction. Matters can progress much more quickly and the issues narrowed faster using this method. The down side is the danger emails represent when they are used for contractual negotiations, and why parties frequently find themselves in binding contracts.</p>
<p>These recent cases show that Courts may be inclined to imply a binding contract is made even though it has not been formally executed. The courts view emails as a modern business tool capable of binding parties and clearing even strict legislative requirements such as having a paper document in writing and signed by the parties.(Property Law Act)</p>
<p>We say loud and clear, to all our business clients, it&#8217;s crucial to manage the risk of being bound by emails. Statements like &#8220;subject to contract&#8221; are not enough. Clearly and consistently state in your emails that no binding agreement is made until a formal contract is executed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It never ceases to amaze me how people can be so trusting when entering into a business transaction with someone they don’t know very well.</p>
<p>As part of small business management, it is usual when acquiring an asset that the director exercises a reasonable level of due diligence before committing to the transaction. Certainly, a high level of scrutiny is given to the purchase of such items as plant and equipment or stock. One can only wonder why a director would leap into a financial or structural change without the same degree of scepticism.</p>
<p>Recently, I encountered another example of a business that had been created with a potential significant time bomb lodged in the structure.</p>
<p>My clients were skilled construction individuals who had created a unique method of surface material application and decided to start their own business.</p>
<p>Lacking the acumen, advice and funding, they accidentally discussed the matter with an unknown third party, who decided to offer them start up finance. A company was duly formed and, on the advice of the accountant for the third party, a change in the constitution occurred.</p>
<p>This was a significant moment in the life and destiny of the business. The accountant made it clear that he was acting only in the interests of the third party investor, but for some inexplicable reason, this did not trigger a warning to the other two to seek independent advice.</p>
<p>As a result, a special class of shares was issued to the third party and highly restrictive voting powers imposed upon the two original shareholders. In fact, the third party forced a change to the constitution to the extent that, at any time, the third party could appoint himself as a director.</p>
<p>The two working directors, who had taken the majority of the business risk, were left having no real control over the company, could not seek out further or alternative funding and certainly could not complain about the management style of the third party.</p>
<p>Regardless of their predicament, they set about working hard in the business seven days a week; taking risky contracts with difficult time lines; employed and managed the staff; juggled cash flow; and somehow managed to repay the third party the principal and interest on time. To make matters worse, from the outset, the spouse of the third party shareholder had a registered first charge over all the assets and undertaking of the company pending receipt of the final payment of principal and interest.</p>
<p>Effectively, upon a minor or technical default, such as production of figures or reports, the spouse could have appointed a receiver at any time.</p>
<p>Eventually, the two original directors reached the end of the period of repayment and, due to the growth in the business and increasing complexity of financial management, they finally sought independent accounting advice. The accountant was surprised to find the change in voting rights and the registered charge had been orchestrated from the outset and gave the directors their first independent view of their position.</p>
<p>It came as a shock for them to understand that they could lose all that they worked for at any time and that, in fact, they at no stage really controlled the company.</p>
<p>No formal meetings were ever held and surprisingly, the third party sat back and let the principal and interest repayments come in without inquiring further.</p>
<p>The next stage of the relationship became critical. Now they had obtained this independent advice they were angry at the way that it had occurred, but understood all to well that now was not the time to incite an argument with the third party or his spouse as secured creditor.</p>
<p>Two crucial outcomes were sought:</p>
<ol>
<li> To ensure that at the point that the loan was repaid in full, a release of charge would be provided in exchange; and</li>
<li>At the same time, a change to the constitution would occur whereby the voting rights would become equal again.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can well understand that they felt a little intimidated, calling a meeting to resolve the matter. On advice, they were open about the agenda for the meeting, the changes they were seeking and produced an independent valuation for the shares. They now realised that they were not guaranteed to free themselves of the existing shareholder with higher voting rights and that, as the company improved its financial position, so too did the value of the shares. The longer they waited to address the matter, the higher the exit price would become for the third party.</p>
<p>From an innocent first handshake discussion they had been outmanoeuvred carefully and had indeed helped create an enemy within.</p>
<p>The choices were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay a premium on the shares; or</li>
<li>Liquidate the company and start again.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the hard work could be undone in a matter of one moment of disagreement with the third party.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the share price reflected a very good capital gain for the third party and the element of risk for the future was enough to convince them to take a clean exit. The two original directors have learned a valuable lesson about business due diligence and they are addressing several other outstanding issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>A formal shareholder’s agreement and a business succession plan, and</li>
<li>A review of their trading terms and conditions and the structure of their finance.</li>
</ul>
<p>They have formal meetings which are recorded and copied to the accountant. The lesson is always the same: <em>If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Carefully consider your responsibilities</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of us are company directors and often sit on boards to assist in the efficient management of the business operations.</p>
<p>Below are a couple of cases worth noting as they have wide implications for those bold enough to put themselves up as an ‘officer’ of a Corporation.</p>
<p><i>Shafron v. Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2012] HCA 18 </i>considered the extent of the duty owed under s.180(1) of the <i>Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). </i>In particular, it considered the extent of the phrase <i>‘in their position and with their responsibilities’ </i>and the definition of <i>‘officer’ </i>under the Corporations Act. The applicant was the company secretary and general counsel of James Hardy Industries Ltd (JHIL) and it was alleged that he <b>had failed to display an appropriate degree of care and diligence</b> in that he <b>failed to give appropriate advice to the board</b> of JHIL on two separate occasions, and on one occasion also failed to give appropriate advice to the chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The principle question before the trial judge, Court of Appeal and High Court was whether the applicant’s responsibilities under s.180(1) extended to his duties as general counsel or were limited to his responsibilities as company secretary. There was no argument that, as company secretary, the applicant was an officer of JHIL, but the applicant argued that his <b>‘responsibilities’ as an officer</b> should be limited to the role that made him an officer, i.e. his position as company secretary. Notwithstanding that the Court ultimately found him to be an officer in either capacity, the High Court held that the duties of an officer under s.180(1) extends to all roles undertaken by the officer within the corporation unless there is a clear distinction between actions undertaken in one capacity and actions undertaken in another. The applicant was not able to demonstrate any such distinction.</p>
<p>It was further argued by the applicant that his duties as company secretary did not extend to the provision of legal advice and that it was not, therefore, a breach of s.180(1) for him to fail to give that advice. The trial judge, Court of Appeal and the High Court all rejected this assertion, concluding that a company secretary with a legal background would be expected to raise legal issues to the board. Even if the applicant was not the general counsel of JHIL, he would still owe this responsibility.</p>
<p>The applicant claimed that he was not, as general counsel, an officer of the company (admitting to being an officer as company secretary) because the general counsel did not make, or participate in making, decisions that affected the whole or a substantial part of the company, as required by s.9(b)(i) of the <i>Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). </i>He submitted that a person participates in making a decision only if they had a part in actually making the decision.</p>
<p>The High Court rejected this argument. The Court held that participating in making a decision required more than simply offering advice and information, but found that the applicant, as a senior executive of JIHL had gone beyond the mere offering of advice. He had played an active part in formulating the proposals that went before the board so, though it was the board that ultimately made the decision, he participated in making it. This was deemed sufficient to make him an officer in his role as general counsel of JIHL.</p>
<p><i>Omnilab Media Pty Ltd v. Digital Cameras Network Pty Ltd [2011] FCAFC 166 </i>considered both the duty of directors to not disclose business opportunities to a rival company and the accessorial liability of that rival company for the loss occasioned by the first company.</p>
<p>In regards to the duty owed by the director, the Federal Court found that the means by which the business opportunity had been acquired was irrelevant, as was any reluctance by the person giving the business opportunity to grant it to Digital Cinema Network Pty Ltd (DCN). What was important is that it was a maturing business opportunity that DCN was actually pursuing. By diverting the business opportunity to another company with which he was associated, the director breached his duty. There was significant evidence that Omnilab Media Pty Ltd (Omnilab) knew that the director was breaching his duty by diverting the business opportunity to them and they therefore had accessorial liability for his breach.</p>
<p><i>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v. Healey and Others [2011] FCA 717</i> considered the duty of directors in relation to annual financial reports.</p>
<p>The directors in that case had relied on management and external advice when adopting and approving the 2007 financial statements. The 2007 statements contained misclassifications and failed to make full disclosure. As a result, the company suffered loss. The Federal Court found that the directors were required to exercise due care and diligence under s.180(1) of the<i> Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)</i> when considering the financial statements and, further, under s.344 then had to take all reasonable steps to ensure the financial statements complied with financial reporting provisions. The Court held that <b>the directors were not entitled to delegate their responsibilities</b> under these sections and, by failing to read, understand and consider the financial statements they had each breached their duties to the company.</p>
<p>This certainly raises the bar for the level of compliance for company officers and all directors or secretaries should take notice!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Each business will have its unique requirements.</strong></p>
<p>I assisted some clients in relation to a business succession agreement for four partners in a successful business.</p>
<p>At the time of formation of the original business entity, there was a simple husband and wife team. Over the years, the business grew. They were joined by their management executive and they sold shares in the company as a result.</p>
<p>The business expanded again and they sold a further tranche of shares to another key management person.</p>
<p>During the expansion phase they also had the opportunity to purchase the business real property from which the business was conducted.</p>
<p>As it was around the time of the last manager’s buy in, he could not afford to purchase an interest in the property as well.</p>
<p>So the end reality was four business owners and three property owners.</p>
<p>They acquired the property in a separate family discretionary trust as tenants in common in one-third shares each. A commercial lease was established between the business trading entity and the three trusts as owners of the property.</p>
<p>All simple so far…</p>
<p>The question arose as to how to deal with the property interests upon death of a principal in the business.</p>
<p>It is a simple matter for the one that did not buy in, as it is simply the value of his interest in the shares of the trading entity. However, when it comes to the buy/sell agreement for the three that have an interest in the property, this was a completely different matter.</p>
<p>The issues are</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the deceased business owner need a continuing interest in the real property</li>
<li>Is there a greater inherent value to the property in light of the commercial lease linked to the business</li>
<li>Should the principals be able to leave the property interest to their family in their estate as a separate matter from the business</li>
<li>Does the buy/sell agreement take account of the goodwill attached to the business premises?</li>
</ol>
<p>These questions were more difficult to answer than I first thought. It was always a regret of the last owner to buy in that he did not acquire an interest in the property as well. It may be that this is dealt with separately and there is no requirement to sell down the interest in the property.</p>
<p>In the interim, a solution was reached so that the value placed upon the business had a recognition of the business premises, pursuant to the long-term lease in place with the current owners.  A simple buy/sell agreement was prepared to allow for self insurance of the principals in the business.</p>
<p>Further, self-owned policies were put in place for the property ownership via the family trusts. It was an issue as to how the mortgage facility was structured and the parties are considering a variation to the agreement that governs the holding of the property. I have recommended that this be included in the buy/sell agreement, to allow the continuing owner that presently does not have a share in the property, a right of first refusal to buy that interest of the departing principal.</p>
<p>All sorted, for now…</p>
