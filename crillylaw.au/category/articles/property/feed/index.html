				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crillylaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Email_Subject_Lines.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1724" src="http://crillylaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Email_Subject_Lines.jpg" alt="Email_Subject_Lines" width="678" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>It is a surprise to many of our clients that the exchange of emails can constitute a binding Contract. The courts are frequently holding people to these Contracts and it is a topic that requires some careful consideration in times where email is the dominant method of communication. Stodgy old paper Agreements with a lengthy witnessing clause might get left on the desk when parties are talking. However, if there is sufficient dialogue and certainty of terms by email, that may be enough to create a legally binding agreement.</p>
<p>When parties are negotiating it is a real danger time and there are some rules that should be followed during those exchanges.</p>
<p>Although the Courts are often perceived as being backwards in regards to technology, they have in fact responded to this shift in communication by accepting email as a means of creating binding agreements.</p>
<p>Not all business managers have caught up with this trend and are regularly placing their company at risk.  It is a mistake to believe that what is said or agreed over email is not binding, and that a legally binding contract is only made when a formal written document is signed.</p>
<p>Take a look at some recent cases with us and let us know if you have a similar issue in your business.</p>
<p><strong>EMAIL NEGOTIATIONS – BINDING OR NOT?</strong></p>
<p>If you have started to negotiate by email but don&#8217;t want your emails to be a binding contract, then you must clearly state in your emails that “<em>no binding agreement is formed unless and until a formal contract has been executed</em>”.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t expressly state this condition, a Court is unlikely to read it that implied in your emails, is the intention to be legally bound.</p>
<p>In May this year, the Queensland Supreme Court held in <em>Stellard Pty Ltd v North Queensland Fuel Pty Ltd</em><sup>1</sup> that a binding contract for the sale of land had been made by email. Amazingly, both the offer email and the email accepting the offer referred to the offer being &#8220;<em>subject to contract</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>subject to execution</em>&#8220;. This was not enough to make the offer conditional apparently.</p>
<p>Following the email exchange, the buyer sent a contract to the seller for execution but it was not signed. The seller later withdrew from the deal and entered into a contract with a third party. This is where the problem started as the buyer had understood the deal to be done.</p>
<p>The Court found that within the broader context of the emails, the parties had intended to be bound immediately. This was the case, even though the parties expected to substitute the agreement with a formal contract containing additional terms. Essentially the guts of the deal had been agreed to and were not able to be refuted.</p>
<p>The Court was also satisfied that the emails met the requirement that a contract for the sale of land be in writing and signed, applying the <em>Electronic Transactions (Queensland) Act 2001</em>(Qld).</p>
<p>The Stellard decision was very similar to an earlier decision this year by the Western Australian Court of Appeal in <em>Vantage Systems Pty Ltd v Priolo Corporation Pty Ltd</em><sup>2</sup>. In this case, it was held that a binding contract to lease commercial premises had been made by a series of emails, despite the emails referring to the offer as being &#8220;<em>subject to formal approval</em>&#8220;. You can see the problem and the pattern here.</p>
<p>In its decision, the Court was not influenced by the fact that the parties could not agree on a reinstatement clause and that no formal lease was ever signed despite the parties&#8217; intentions to do so.</p>
<p>The &#8216;binding email&#8217; trend extends to settlement negotiations between lawyers by email.</p>
<p>In late June, the NSW Supreme Court found a binding settlement agreement had been made by email between lawyers in <em>Universal Music Australia Pty Limited v Pavlovic</em><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The Court held that the lawyer&#8217;s email stating that the client would sign the settlement deed, combined with the rest of the communications and conduct, was enough to create a binding contract. Whoops! It is a very old practice to ensure that you state “this offer is subject to final instructions from our client” just to cover your backside.</p>
<p>Although it was intended that a deed would be signed (and it never was), the Court refused to imply from the emails that no binding agreement would be created until the deed was actually signed.</p>
<p><strong>THE SEDUCING BY EMAIL</strong></p>
<p>The speed and casual ease with which emails can be written and exchanged is their attraction. Matters can progress much more quickly and the issues narrowed faster using this method. The down side is the danger emails represent when they are used for contractual negotiations, and why parties frequently find themselves in binding contracts.</p>
<p>These recent cases show that Courts may be inclined to imply a binding contract is made even though it has not been formally executed. The courts view emails as a modern business tool capable of binding parties and clearing even strict legislative requirements such as having a paper document in writing and signed by the parties.(Property Law Act)</p>
<p>We say loud and clear, to all our business clients, it&#8217;s crucial to manage the risk of being bound by emails. Statements like &#8220;subject to contract&#8221; are not enough. Clearly and consistently state in your emails that no binding agreement is made until a formal contract is executed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The significance of timely registration of security interests under the Personal Property and Securities Act (PPSA) has been delivered in the recent case of Relux Commercial Pty Ltd (in liq) v Doka Formwork Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>The case required consideration of Section 588FL of the Corporations Act. Section 588FL provides that certain security interests under the PPSA not registered on the Personal Property and Securities Register (PPSR) within a certain period vest in the company that is being wound up.</p>
<p>This case involved the following facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Relux rented formwork equipment from Doka Formwork Pty Ltd (Doka) and operated a formwork construction business.</li>
<li>Relux Commercial Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (Relux) appointed administrators on 7 April 2014, and had possession of the formwork equipment. The administrators were appointed liquidators on 16 May 2014 at a creditors meeting.</li>
<li>From March 2013 Doka leased the formwork equipment to Relux for indefinite periods. But, only on 20 February 2014 did Doka register a PPSR security interest.</li>
<li>Formwork equipment was provided to Relux in 2013, while some had been leased in February and March 2014.</li>
<li>The liquidators applied to the court for a decision on who had superior rights and interest in the formwork equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>His Honour determined that Doka’s leases were ‘PPS leases’ under Section 13 of the PPSA because they were for indefinite periods, and Doka’s business leased such goods to the public.</p>
<p>His Honour then considered the Corporations Act, Section 588FL, regarding the timing of Doka’s registration.</p>
<p>Section 588FL provides a PPSA security interest vests in a company where, at the time of administration or liquidation:</p>
<p>(a) The security interest is enforceable against third parties.</p>
<p>(b) The security interest is perfected by registration.</p>
<p>(c) The security registration time is after the latest of:</p>
<ol>
<li>six months before the administration or liquidation of the company</li>
<li>20 business days after the security interest was created, or the day of administration, or liquidation (whichever is earliest)</li>
</ol>
<p>His Honor determined that (a) and (b) applied to this case and that the dates following  applied to Doka’s registration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six months before the critical time of 7 April 2014 (Appointment of Administrators), was 7 October 2013; or</li>
</ul>
<p>The earlier of:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 business days after the security agreement that gave rise to the security interest came into force was 21 February 2014; or</li>
<li>The critical time of 7 April 2014.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given Doka registered its interest on 20 February 2014, the court found that any formwork equipment leased prior to 21 January 2014 (i.e.. 20 business days before registration) and after 7 October 2013 (i.e.. 6 months prior to the administration) would vest in Relux. That is, despite Doka being the lawful owner of the formwork, it lost its formwork equipment to Relux’s liquidator.</p>
<p>The court found that the leases in February and March 2014 was covered by Doka’s security registration, and therefore Section 588FL didn’t apply—as it was registered in time.</p>
<p>This case is the second to prove to be a substantive judicial consideration of the PPSA (<a href="http://www.worrells.net.au/eUpdateNewsletters/ViewArticleListing.aspx?ArticleId=5486">for the first, Maiden Civil case, click here</a>). The take-home message is: ensure security interests are registered within 20 days of creation, or risk losing those assets—particularly if the leasee entity is placed into external administration within 6 months of a late registration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apart from wishing everybody an early Merry Christmas and Prosperous New Year, we would like to take this opportunity to invite you to complete a short survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This makes it easier for us to identify the limits of the instruction and for our clients to understand exactly what it is they can achieve as an outcome. Ask us about our fixed fee client agreement and please complete the below survey which should really only take about two minutes of your time. Note that the first four surveys will get a free bottle of French champagne as a bonus. Thanks very much, we look forward to the opportunity to act of your behalf.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is amazing to see how the tax and stamp duty implications of a proposed transaction change the outcome for clients. We have done a lot of work in conjunction with some strategic accounting firms in structuring a business or a transaction for a change in ownership in a way that optimises the interests of all parties. The key point here is to have the original plan in an open discussion with a strategic advice to identify potential options open to the parties, before they sign any transaction documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enormous financial benefit can be achieved both in the short and the long term if clients stop and explore these options first. We are constantly amazed at the potential advantages that clients can achieve by just taking the time to consider alternatives to a proposed transaction and their individual tax circumstances. If you are thinking of a change of ownership or structure in your business, make sure you give us a call first in plenty of time so that the revenue aspects are optimised.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are significant changes commencing on 1 December 2014 which effect all property contracts and appointment of agents. The simple solution is to always check any documents before you sign. Everyone must be diligent in making sure that the regulations are complied with otherwise you cannot assume that a transaction will complete as expected. Given the size of the average property transaction it is highly beneficial to have at least 30 minutes of professional advice before proceeding. We are very happy to review contract prior to execution and give advice about the terms. Our view is by adding a simple but clear Special Condition an enormous amount of heartache can be saved at the pointy end of the transaction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Each business will have its unique requirements.</strong></p>
<p>I assisted some clients in relation to a business succession agreement for four partners in a successful business.</p>
<p>At the time of formation of the original business entity, there was a simple husband and wife team. Over the years, the business grew. They were joined by their management executive and they sold shares in the company as a result.</p>
<p>The business expanded again and they sold a further tranche of shares to another key management person.</p>
<p>During the expansion phase they also had the opportunity to purchase the business real property from which the business was conducted.</p>
<p>As it was around the time of the last manager’s buy in, he could not afford to purchase an interest in the property as well.</p>
<p>So the end reality was four business owners and three property owners.</p>
<p>They acquired the property in a separate family discretionary trust as tenants in common in one-third shares each. A commercial lease was established between the business trading entity and the three trusts as owners of the property.</p>
<p>All simple so far…</p>
<p>The question arose as to how to deal with the property interests upon death of a principal in the business.</p>
<p>It is a simple matter for the one that did not buy in, as it is simply the value of his interest in the shares of the trading entity. However, when it comes to the buy/sell agreement for the three that have an interest in the property, this was a completely different matter.</p>
<p>The issues are</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the deceased business owner need a continuing interest in the real property</li>
<li>Is there a greater inherent value to the property in light of the commercial lease linked to the business</li>
<li>Should the principals be able to leave the property interest to their family in their estate as a separate matter from the business</li>
<li>Does the buy/sell agreement take account of the goodwill attached to the business premises?</li>
</ol>
<p>These questions were more difficult to answer than I first thought. It was always a regret of the last owner to buy in that he did not acquire an interest in the property as well. It may be that this is dealt with separately and there is no requirement to sell down the interest in the property.</p>
<p>In the interim, a solution was reached so that the value placed upon the business had a recognition of the business premises, pursuant to the long-term lease in place with the current owners.  A simple buy/sell agreement was prepared to allow for self insurance of the principals in the business.</p>
<p>Further, self-owned policies were put in place for the property ownership via the family trusts. It was an issue as to how the mortgage facility was structured and the parties are considering a variation to the agreement that governs the holding of the property. I have recommended that this be included in the buy/sell agreement, to allow the continuing owner that presently does not have a share in the property, a right of first refusal to buy that interest of the departing principal.</p>
<p>All sorted, for now…</p>
