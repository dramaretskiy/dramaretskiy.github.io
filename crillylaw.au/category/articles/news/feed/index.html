				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Last year, the Federal Government announced it would introduce new laws to enable &#8220;Mum and Dad investors&#8221; to invest directly in start-up companies. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Some of the changes to existing laws include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a 5 day cooling off period; </strong></li>
<li><strong>an increase in the allowable cap on funds to be raised;</strong></li>
<li><strong>a higher level of money to be held, up to $5 million.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding) Bill 2015</em> aims at allowing small companies to attract investment in their business by the public injecting equity via “crowdfunding” as an on-line method.</p>
<p>This is a revelation in the prior laws and runs against the regulations and political background which have resisted this method of capital raising.</p>
<p>The key amendments are to the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em> and will provide for a large number of shareholders to apply for shares in return for share capital in the start-up companies.</p>
<p>Despite this forward thinking development in the law there are some sections of the business community that have expressed frustration with the proposed laws on the basis they do not go far enough and impose too many restrictions. The experience in other countries, such as Israel, point to alternative methods which are faster and less regulated in the process of raising essential capital for these new companies.</p>
<p>As a form of consumer protection, the Australian legislation now requires that investors must go through appropriately licenced crowdfunding procedures.</p>
<p>These procedures require a high level of due diligence on the proposal, to avoid likely misleading or deceptive conduct by company promoters.</p>
<p>The public as investors are “consumers” under the Act and are strongly encouraged to seek their own independent advice on the potential investment. The requirements include investors confirming they make their own decisions on the level of risk in losing their investment, by an acknowledgement statement required to be signed as part of the investment process.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, previously stated the preferred model is that adopted by New Zealand in 2014. That model allows the number of potential investors to be unrestricted (not limited to 20). A larger number of investors can purchase smaller amounts of shares, without a Prospectus. This resulted in 21 companies raising $12.1 million with an average investment of $4,100.00. Let’s wait and see what happens over the coming months.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very Happy New Year to everyone and I hope 2016 is amazing for you and your family.</p>
<p>I start this year wrestling with the issue of taxation on deceased estates. It is very often overlooked by the key beneficiaries of an estate as they are always keen to get their hands on the cash.</p>
<p>The problem is, before the Executor can make a payment, they must assess exactly what tax is payable, otherwise they will find themselves personally liable for the assessment by the ATO and no funds with which to pay the bill.</p>
<p>With rising balances held in self managed super funds it is more than likely that there will be a death benefit payable from that as the source of funds. Before making payments the trustee must calculate the tax payable to the person based on their status as a “tax dependant” or not.</p>
<p>A spouse will be able to receive a super fund payment without tax but a non-dependant adult child may not, subject to age, living at home status and study.</p>
<p>It is very important a Will maker take into account the different tax consequences for different individuals when making an allocation between family members in terms of the overall estate assets, including family trusts and super. This gets even trickier when you have second or third marriage status and children of prior relationships. How do you ensure they get their share but allow the source of income to continue for the spouse?</p>
<p>Control of a self managed super fund is critical and often the surviving spouse will want to maintain the assets within the fund if possible, so they can continue to receive the benefit of the tax status. It may be that the shares and Directorship as well as the constitution of the trustee company of a super fund, must be amended to ensure the right outcome is achieved and secured.</p>
<p>We are able to help our clients navigate the maze of legislation to achieve the right outcome according to their preferred allocation of estate assets.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to cover control of super funds after you lose capacity. A special purpose Enduring Power of Attorney is essential to appoint the right person to control the fund and to allow access for medical and living expenses.</p>
<p>I suggest that all Estate and Succession planning should be done in conjunction with the Financial Advisor and super fund or tax accountant, to achieve the maximum benefits.</p>
<p>Remember, it is too late when you have lost the ability to make decisions or when you die.</p>
<p>Do it now while you have time and invest the energy and expense to get it right.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us at some point know someone that has told us about illegally downloading a movie via an internet site. It seems unfair for those of us who pay full price through iTunes but most of us just figure that the younger generation are smarter than us.</p>
<p>A new Federal Court case sheds some light on the rights of the movie makers as owners of the copyright and those pesky downloaders. What happens when they get caught and how do they get caught?</p>
<p>It seems from the evidence in the Dallas Buyers Club Movie (DBC) and a group of Internet Service Providers (ISP), including IINet, Internode and Dodo, that the fight continues. On 14 August the Federal Court gave an indication of the compensation copyright owners can expect to claim in future copyright breach matters and how the illegal downloaders might expect to receive a bill.</p>
<p>What happened here was a digital investigator found 4,726 IP Addresses from which the DBC movie was illegally downloaded and shared on &#8220;Bit Torrent&#8221;. The owner sought a Court Order requiring the relevant ISP to provide details of the owners of the IP Addresses.</p>
<p>To get an Order like this they had to demonstrate a right to obtain relief against potential Defendants, namely the ISP account holders. The judge ordered the ISP to provide this information but DBC had to provide the letter of demand to the account holders. The concern here was an unreasonable demand for the level of damages suffered from the copyright infringement.</p>
<p>In terms of the amount of money the owner of the copyright intended to claim, the letters set out four things:-</p>
<ol>
<li>A claim for the cost of downloading a film;</li>
<li>A claim relating to the uploading or sharing of the film on Bit Torrent;</li>
<li>A claim relating to additional damages because of repeat infringing;</li>
<li>A claim for part of the costs of proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The general principle is that damages must put the party who has had their rights breached, in the same position it would have been in, had the infringement never occurred.</p>
<p>The judge found that a claim relating to the cost of downloading the film and a claim for a proportionate part of the cost of proceedings was permissible. However the Court found that a claim relating to the uploading or sharing of the film on Bit Torrent and additional damages due to potential repeat infringements was not.</p>
<p>I learnt that a user downloads slivers of a movie file from many other uses, and the slivers are then put together to form the full movie. By doing this Bit Torrent automatically shares and uploads the slivers of the file to each of the other downloaders. It must be a Gen Y thing!</p>
<p>The owners of the copyright claim that each sliver shared was actionable. This meant they would have been charged for sharing the film on the internet at full price for each sliver. The Court found this was not permissible even though it was clearly designed to act as a deterrent to the illegal downloading.</p>
<p>The Court also found additional damages could be claimed when taking into account all the other relevant matters including downloaders history on Bit Torrent so that the more they downloaded, the higher the additional damages should be. The Court found that this approach by the copyright owner was not reasonable and it came back to the cost of hiring the film by download and a proportionate part of the cost of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The Court said they would only allow access to the identities of the downloaders if DBC undertook to make a claim for the cost of download of the movie and proportionate part of the proceedings only. The Court required the foreign based owner of the copyright to pay a bond of $600,000.00 to the Court which would be lost if they failed to follow the undertakings. Heavy stuff!</p>
<p>So the general principles to be derived are:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal downloaders can be pursued by virtue of the ISP; and</li>
<li>Reasonable damages will be awarded as well as a proportionate part of the cost of the action of the breach, but no more.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tricky situation for an owner of a copyright is, will the costs of proceedings and pursuing the illegal downloaders and recovering small amount of damages be cost effective and enough of a deterrent. It certainly makes you think very carefully about how technology is disrupting the traditional framework of access to material, rights to exercise over the cost of sharing copyright material and whether any potential claims are adequate deterrent from doing it.</p>
<p>Owners of copyright of should think very carefully about how it is shared by the internet. Call us if you would like to discuss your copyright issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crillylaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Email_Subject_Lines.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1724" src="http://crillylaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Email_Subject_Lines.jpg" alt="Email_Subject_Lines" width="678" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>It is a surprise to many of our clients that the exchange of emails can constitute a binding Contract. The courts are frequently holding people to these Contracts and it is a topic that requires some careful consideration in times where email is the dominant method of communication. Stodgy old paper Agreements with a lengthy witnessing clause might get left on the desk when parties are talking. However, if there is sufficient dialogue and certainty of terms by email, that may be enough to create a legally binding agreement.</p>
<p>When parties are negotiating it is a real danger time and there are some rules that should be followed during those exchanges.</p>
<p>Although the Courts are often perceived as being backwards in regards to technology, they have in fact responded to this shift in communication by accepting email as a means of creating binding agreements.</p>
<p>Not all business managers have caught up with this trend and are regularly placing their company at risk.  It is a mistake to believe that what is said or agreed over email is not binding, and that a legally binding contract is only made when a formal written document is signed.</p>
<p>Take a look at some recent cases with us and let us know if you have a similar issue in your business.</p>
<p><strong>EMAIL NEGOTIATIONS – BINDING OR NOT?</strong></p>
<p>If you have started to negotiate by email but don&#8217;t want your emails to be a binding contract, then you must clearly state in your emails that “<em>no binding agreement is formed unless and until a formal contract has been executed</em>”.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t expressly state this condition, a Court is unlikely to read it that implied in your emails, is the intention to be legally bound.</p>
<p>In May this year, the Queensland Supreme Court held in <em>Stellard Pty Ltd v North Queensland Fuel Pty Ltd</em><sup>1</sup> that a binding contract for the sale of land had been made by email. Amazingly, both the offer email and the email accepting the offer referred to the offer being &#8220;<em>subject to contract</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>subject to execution</em>&#8220;. This was not enough to make the offer conditional apparently.</p>
<p>Following the email exchange, the buyer sent a contract to the seller for execution but it was not signed. The seller later withdrew from the deal and entered into a contract with a third party. This is where the problem started as the buyer had understood the deal to be done.</p>
<p>The Court found that within the broader context of the emails, the parties had intended to be bound immediately. This was the case, even though the parties expected to substitute the agreement with a formal contract containing additional terms. Essentially the guts of the deal had been agreed to and were not able to be refuted.</p>
<p>The Court was also satisfied that the emails met the requirement that a contract for the sale of land be in writing and signed, applying the <em>Electronic Transactions (Queensland) Act 2001</em>(Qld).</p>
<p>The Stellard decision was very similar to an earlier decision this year by the Western Australian Court of Appeal in <em>Vantage Systems Pty Ltd v Priolo Corporation Pty Ltd</em><sup>2</sup>. In this case, it was held that a binding contract to lease commercial premises had been made by a series of emails, despite the emails referring to the offer as being &#8220;<em>subject to formal approval</em>&#8220;. You can see the problem and the pattern here.</p>
<p>In its decision, the Court was not influenced by the fact that the parties could not agree on a reinstatement clause and that no formal lease was ever signed despite the parties&#8217; intentions to do so.</p>
<p>The &#8216;binding email&#8217; trend extends to settlement negotiations between lawyers by email.</p>
<p>In late June, the NSW Supreme Court found a binding settlement agreement had been made by email between lawyers in <em>Universal Music Australia Pty Limited v Pavlovic</em><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The Court held that the lawyer&#8217;s email stating that the client would sign the settlement deed, combined with the rest of the communications and conduct, was enough to create a binding contract. Whoops! It is a very old practice to ensure that you state “this offer is subject to final instructions from our client” just to cover your backside.</p>
<p>Although it was intended that a deed would be signed (and it never was), the Court refused to imply from the emails that no binding agreement would be created until the deed was actually signed.</p>
<p><strong>THE SEDUCING BY EMAIL</strong></p>
<p>The speed and casual ease with which emails can be written and exchanged is their attraction. Matters can progress much more quickly and the issues narrowed faster using this method. The down side is the danger emails represent when they are used for contractual negotiations, and why parties frequently find themselves in binding contracts.</p>
<p>These recent cases show that Courts may be inclined to imply a binding contract is made even though it has not been formally executed. The courts view emails as a modern business tool capable of binding parties and clearing even strict legislative requirements such as having a paper document in writing and signed by the parties.(Property Law Act)</p>
<p>We say loud and clear, to all our business clients, it&#8217;s crucial to manage the risk of being bound by emails. Statements like &#8220;subject to contract&#8221; are not enough. Clearly and consistently state in your emails that no binding agreement is made until a formal contract is executed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to 2015! How lucky we are to have the chance to try, yet again, to create a life that we want to live, with what we have been given.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a case of finding clarity in the cloud of confusion that is everyday life.</p>
<p>This time of year, we attempt to make strong resolutions about how we will do things differently and yet it can come unstuck so very easily.</p>
<p>I thought I would share a few of my New Year musings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn from last years’ mistakes;</li>
<li>Be more careful in my decisions;</li>
<li>Take the positive approach;</li>
<li>Try harder at everything I do;</li>
<li>Be kinder and more patient;</li>
<li>Drink more tea and less alcohol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well I seem to have busted number one already which means I failed in taking a more moderate approach to work and life. This is the human condition, but strive we must.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something more about planning leading to greater success. Prepare a checklist, tick the boxes and TRAIN, TRAIN, TRAIN!</p>
<p>Perhaps it is more like Zen and the Art of Motor Cycle Maintenance, which I have been reading. It is not the endpoint result that counts, it is the way the journey is travelled that is important.</p>
<p>Either way, the best you can do is to give it your best shot.</p>
<p>My other New Year points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you get your legal things in order just in case;</li>
<li>Review the important contracts in your life such as insurance, super and investments;</li>
<li>Make a personal and business plan including a holiday as a reward;</li>
<li>Keep your body moving to some fitness program;</li>
<li>Consult an independent advisor to keep your finances on track;</li>
<li>Make time to think outside the box each week to ensure you are on the right path.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are not very specific but it is strange how many of the issues that we deal with from a legal perspective come down to a problem not addressed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Many times during expensive and arduous litigation clients have asked themselves “why didn’t we do something sooner?”</p>
<p>We hope to encourage clients to talk to us at the earliest opportunity so we can do a better job and achieve more valuable outcomes for them.</p>
<p>This year we are inviting our business clients to see us after hours when required and to collaborate with us in preparing a plan for their matter. This means time and money budgets as well as defined outcomes.</p>
<p>If we can save you money we will, but we try to make sure it is not short sighted. If we would not do it ourselves we will not recommend it.</p>
<p>This year we plan to improve our technology and research platforms, add another business to the group and to improve our systems and procedures to deliver more consistently great work. Back to the lists I think!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been providing feedback by our quick survey and please take the chance to have your say at the link below.</p>
<p><a title="Crilly Lawyers Survey" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MW68HZW">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MW68HZW</a></p>
<p>To achieve greater peace of mind, we can help you to get your corporate agreements in place, prepare a new will, power of attorney and health directive, check your super fund deed, review your family trust and prepare a plan that protects your assets and maximises the exit value from your business. Contact us for more information today.</p>
<p>Have a great year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apart from wishing everybody an early Merry Christmas and Prosperous New Year, we would like to take this opportunity to invite you to complete a short survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We think that it is more important than ever that we canvas your views on the types of services that you want and your attitude to risk and value. Even though we have a detailed knowledge in the law, it is the specific tailoring of your requirements within that framework that we really want to target. As an example, we have moved far more towards a fixed fee for a set list of deliverable items as a scope of work. This makes it easier for us to identify the limits of the instruction and for our clients to understand exactly what it is they can achieve as an outcome. Ask us about our fixed fee client agreement and please complete the below survey which should really only take about two minutes of your time. Note that the first four surveys will get a free bottle of French champagne as a bonus. Thanks very much, we look forward to the opportunity to act of your behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take the time to complete our survey below, we would love to hear from you</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crilly Lawyers is pleased to offer a new fixed-fee IP and Technology Audit service for businesses.</p>
<p>The importance of a businesses&#8217; intellectual property and technology assets is often overlooked, but can quite often be the most valuable asset the business owns. Unfortunately, these assets are often allowed to languish or slip through a businesses&#8217; fingers due to poor management or understanding of these assets. The unwary business can also find itself unwittingly in breach of laws or contracts; a particularly prominent risk given recent legal developments including amendments to intellectual property and privacy laws.</p>
<p>The IP &amp; Technology Audit is a high level review of all your intellectual property and technology issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>copyright, patents and designs;</li>
<li>registered and unregistered trade marks;</li>
<li>confidentiality and trade secrets;</li>
<li>intellectual property licenses and disputes;</li>
<li>software and technology licenses and contracts;</li>
<li>websites, social media and online activities; and</li>
<li>privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our solicitors will attend your offices for a day and review your existing intellectual property and technology arrangements. After our review, you will receive a report outlining all your current intellectual property rights and technology contracts and our recommendations on any issues that we may have identified. We have a number of solicitors qualified in science and technology and can identify niche concerns for your consideration with industry experience.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact <a title="Tony Crilly" href="http://crillylaw.com.au/our-people/tony-crilly/">Tony Crilly</a> at our office.</p>
