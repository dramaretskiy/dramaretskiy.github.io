<p>What happens to your business when you die or become disabled?</p>
<p>Most business owners are flat out managing staff, payroll, creditors, customers and technical changes, which means there is little time left to plan for risks.</p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions in getting things sorted:-</p>
<p><strong>1. Enduring Power of Attorney </strong>– Get this signed and make sure it covers trusts and companies as well as your personal capacity for financial and health matters;</p>
<p><strong>2. General Power of Attorney </strong>– Where appropriate, you should sign a General Power of Attorney if you are sole Director of your company to make it easier to deal with banks and other companies with whom you contract;</p>
<p><strong>3. Insurance &#8211; </strong>Get insurance to cover at least part of your business debt level, cash flow requirements for 6 months and<strong> </strong>immediate expenses. In terms of goodwill, if you have a shareholder or partner you must insure for the value of your business interest or equity.</p>
<p><strong>4. Business Succession Agreement </strong>– You must have a written agreement with your shareholders or partners that provides for a conditional grant of an option to acquire the balance business from you or your family trust as owner of the share. If it is not written correctly, stamp duty and capital gains tax will rise as at the date of the Deed leaving a worse revenue outcome for your family.</p>
<p><strong>5. A Valid Will on the best terms – </strong>Everyone should take the opportunity to prepare a valid Will that covers all of their circumstances including business interests companies, shares, trusts and property, on terms that provide the best outcomes for their family. It is a small price to pay for a well drafted Will if it provides protection of beneficiaries for bankruptcy, disability and matrimonial disputes. By drafting key terms you can ensure that tax is minimized in the family group including children being taxed at adult rates and a wider class within which to distribute income such as trusts and companies. You can cover forgiveness of loans between family companies and trusts where there have been distributions for tax but no payments made.</p>
<p><strong>6. Digital Assets</strong> – You should make sure adequate wording is included in your Enduring Power of Attorney and your Will to cover access to and ability to deal with digital assets. These include bank accounts, investment portfolios, family photographs and social media accounts. Make sure you cover ownership of domain names, email accounts and cloud based back up accounts so that your chosen Attorney or Executor can gain access to and control these assets according to your wishes.</p>
<p><strong>7. Advance Health Directive</strong> &#8211; Take the time to get this documents reviewed by your General Medical Practitioner and make your decisions regarding end of life treatment. Do not leave it open for family members to argue about pain relief, CPR, hydration surgery, antibiotics or other treatments when you may have lost the ability to communicate, are terminal or end up in a permanent coma.</p>
<p><strong>8. Binding Nominations for Superannuation &#8211; </strong>Many of our clients have not checked to ensure their Wills match the updated Binding Nominations that their accountant or financial advisor have put in place. Given the substantial changes in the legislation starting on 1 July 2017, we recommend all clients review this aspect as a matter of urgency. Do not wait until it is too late as your family will suffer the consequences of addition tax payable on your super nest egg built up over many years.</p>
<p>So these are just 8 simple points to tick off to ensure you are in the best possible position as a business owner. Take the time to get a review. It will only be 1 hour of discussion and is best done with your accountant/ financial and legal advisor together.</p>

<p><strong>Is your Self Managed Super Fund a disaster waiting to happen?</strong></p>
<p>Wow! What a question! If you are like most of our business and investor clients, then you will have already established a self managed super fund (SMSF).</p>
<p>I wonder how that came about. Did your financial advisor tell you about the benefits? Was it your accountant just trying to save you capital gains tax on a sale of a significant asset?</p>
<p>All SMSFs are established with a set of rules contained in a Trust Deed. The Deed is vital to the operation and compliance of the fund.</p>
<p>We want to alert you to problems that can arise with  SMSF Deeds and what you can do about it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Establishment of the fund</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When the Trust deed is prepared it will have a section in which the Trustees need to sign to accept their role and confirm the terms of the deed.  Signing these papers might seem simple but common mistakes can cause a great deal of problems and costs later on.  A couple of common mistakes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed trustee signs the deed <strong>‘as trustee’ rather than personally;</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>date the Deed is signed</strong> is before the proposed <strong>corporate trustee</strong> has been established.</li>
</ul>
<p>Signing as ‘as trustee’, cannot occur until the formal establishment of the fund has been completed. Questions as to the proper execution of the deed and the capacity in which the deed was signed can arise if you get it wrong.</p>
<p>Secondly, a company cannot be taken to have properly executed a deed if the date of the document is a date earlier than the incorporation date for the company.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Variation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For a variation to a SMSF Trust Deed to be valid, it must be done strictly in accordance with the powers stated in the deed immediately prior to the variation. For example, if the fund deed requires that <strong>the fund member</strong>(s) alone can vary the terms of the fund deed, then a variation of that deed by the fund trustee(s), in that capacity, will be invalid. If the fund trustee is permitted to vary the fund deed but only with the <strong>consent of the fund members</strong>, then that consent must be obtained in writing (at the time).</p>
<p>If the rules for the SMSF are not properly varied, then the trustee may be forced to accept that the rules in place immediately prior to the  variation will continue apply. The ATO does not care if you are technically wrong and want to fix it. Timing is everything!.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Change of trustee</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The variations required for changes to the SMSF trustee (including by adding a new trustee) – must be completed strictly in accordance with the rules for the fund. This might seem boring but stay with me. If you get it wrong it means someone other than you may be in control of the super fund. (like a former spouse who uses the company for another purpose)</p>
<p>Check the Deed to see if  individual trustees or a company must act as trustee.</p>
<p>The defective drafting usually only comes to light when someone wants to rely on what is believed to be the current fund rules – by which time it might be too late to remedy the problem, without great expense.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Transactions/dealings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When entering a transaction or undertaking some sort of action involving a third party (buying a property) often brings to light defects in SMSF documentation. Banks and other Financiers will read the terms of the Deed strictly or a party to a contract will check  to be certain that there will be no problems enforcing that contract against a fund trustee.</p>
<p>What happens if the Trustee does not have the power to enter into the transaction? Can you just later amend the rules for the SMSF to include the relevant power? If it were only that simple.  The fund trustee can be bound legally to perform but with a question as to whether it was a valid exercise of power. The financier might refuse to lend the funds necessary unless and until a further Variation is signed. A costly and most likely, urgent problem to deal with.  The end result – a number of deeds that fixes the initial problem, but creates a paper trail that is much harder to follow.</p>
<p>Does the invalid trustee appointment give the ATO a right to challenge the transactions entered into by the trustee and will that cause additional tax to be payable?</p>
<p>If the change relates to a change in the law then it is best to get this done when recommended by your accounting advisor or fund auditor.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>A Prudent Approach</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A sensible position to take is every time you handle a SMSF ask whetehr it an be checked for compliance. Every time you make a change, resolve key decisions, appoint a trustee or add or remove a member, make sure the basic establishment facts are checked.</p>
<p>Don’t  risk failing to have a valid document for your retirement intentions, your clever investment strategies and the payment of benefits from the SMSF on death!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is of great interest to us and most of our clients, how a Discretionary Family Trust dictates what will happen to their assets in the future. Most of our clients use Family Trusts as a wealth creation vehicle giving the flexibility for income distribution and Capital Gains Tax. It is really critical to understand that the assets within a Family Trust are not owned by the individual rather it is a control over the management of the trust and exercise of discretion as trustee that dictate the outcome.</p>
<p>Consider the recent high profile case of Gina Reinhart in the dispute with her children over the control of the key trust that owned significant business interests. The &#8220;appointor&#8221; is the named individual that can appoint or remove &#8220;trustee&#8221; of the trust. The trustee has the day to day management and control of the trust and exercises discretion about business or investment decisions. However, if there is a dispute then the appointor can remove the trustee and insert a replacement trustee.</p>
<p>It is vitally important that clients have the Trust Deed reviewed to check exactly who the appointor is and if they die, become disabled or insolvent, who in default will be appointed in that role. The last thing you want is for a trustee in bankruptcy to be controlling all of the assets and exercising the discretion to pay creditors. In addition, it is difficult for clients to dictate from the grave what will happen to those trust assets in the future on their demise.</p>
<p>So what happens after you are dead to the property, money and shares you have built up over a lifetime? You might not be able to “rule from the grave” but you can organise the players and stack the odds in favour of certain outcomes.</p>
<p>Ask us about how we can prepare a clear set of &#8220;Guiding Principles for Trusts&#8221; which can set out in detail the preferred exercise of discretion on specific future events. This is of great significance when there are business assets held or large property interests. We would be delighted to share with you our solutions in this regard and share with you the peace of mind that can be achieved by preparing these documents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We often see Family Discretionary Trust Deeds which were set up several years (or event decades) earlier.  It is often overlooked that circumstances may have changed significantly since the Trust was established and that the ultimate controller of the Trust may not be the expected person.</p>
<p>The case of <a href="http://www.sclqld.org.au/caselaw/QSC/2015/359"><em>Kniepp v Annuaka Pty Ltd</em></a>  last year is a reminder of the potential risks. In that case, a Discretionary Trust established in 1991 named a deceased’s first wife as the person with the power to change the Trustee of the Trust (sometimes this person is called an &#8216;Appointor’). Despite divorce in 1995, the first wife’s power was never dealt with or removed. 19 years after separation she attempted to exercise her power to seize control of the Trust Fund.</p>
<p>Although she was not successful on account of jurisdictional issue and interpretation of the specific Trust Deed in this case, the risk was real and potentially disastrous for the last family of the deceased.</p>
<p>The person with power to change the Trustee of a Discretionary Trust can often be forgotten about over time. It is a case of ‘out of sight, out of mind’ unless the Trust Deed is reviewed periodically.   There is also a tendency to view Discretionary Trusts as ‘carbon copies’ of one another with identical functionality and governing rules.</p>
<p>However, the precise terms of the trust deed are critical and we recommend to all our clients that Discretionary Trust Deeds are reviewed every few years to ensure it is appropriate given the current Law and individual circumstances.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very Happy New Year to everyone and I hope 2016 is amazing for you and your family.</p>
<p>I start this year wrestling with the issue of taxation on deceased estates. It is very often overlooked by the key beneficiaries of an estate as they are always keen to get their hands on the cash.</p>
<p>The problem is, before the Executor can make a payment, they must assess exactly what tax is payable, otherwise they will find themselves personally liable for the assessment by the ATO and no funds with which to pay the bill.</p>
<p>With rising balances held in self managed super funds it is more than likely that there will be a death benefit payable from that as the source of funds. Before making payments the trustee must calculate the tax payable to the person based on their status as a “tax dependant” or not.</p>
<p>A spouse will be able to receive a super fund payment without tax but a non-dependant adult child may not, subject to age, living at home status and study.</p>
<p>It is very important a Will maker take into account the different tax consequences for different individuals when making an allocation between family members in terms of the overall estate assets, including family trusts and super. This gets even trickier when you have second or third marriage status and children of prior relationships. How do you ensure they get their share but allow the source of income to continue for the spouse?</p>
<p>Control of a self managed super fund is critical and often the surviving spouse will want to maintain the assets within the fund if possible, so they can continue to receive the benefit of the tax status. It may be that the shares and Directorship as well as the constitution of the trustee company of a super fund, must be amended to ensure the right outcome is achieved and secured.</p>
<p>We are able to help our clients navigate the maze of legislation to achieve the right outcome according to their preferred allocation of estate assets.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to cover control of super funds after you lose capacity. A special purpose Enduring Power of Attorney is essential to appoint the right person to control the fund and to allow access for medical and living expenses.</p>
<p>I suggest that all Estate and Succession planning should be done in conjunction with the Financial Advisor and super fund or tax accountant, to achieve the maximum benefits.</p>
<p>Remember, it is too late when you have lost the ability to make decisions or when you die.</p>
<p>Do it now while you have time and invest the energy and expense to get it right.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to 2015! How lucky we are to have the chance to try, yet again, to create a life that we want to live, with what we have been given.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a case of finding clarity in the cloud of confusion that is everyday life.</p>
<p>This time of year, we attempt to make strong resolutions about how we will do things differently and yet it can come unstuck so very easily.</p>
<p>I thought I would share a few of my New Year musings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn from last years’ mistakes;</li>
<li>Be more careful in my decisions;</li>
<li>Take the positive approach;</li>
<li>Try harder at everything I do;</li>
<li>Be kinder and more patient;</li>
<li>Drink more tea and less alcohol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well I seem to have busted number one already which means I failed in taking a more moderate approach to work and life. This is the human condition, but strive we must.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something more about planning leading to greater success. Prepare a checklist, tick the boxes and TRAIN, TRAIN, TRAIN!</p>
<p>Perhaps it is more like Zen and the Art of Motor Cycle Maintenance, which I have been reading. It is not the endpoint result that counts, it is the way the journey is travelled that is important.</p>
<p>Either way, the best you can do is to give it your best shot.</p>
<p>My other New Year points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you get your legal things in order just in case;</li>
<li>Review the important contracts in your life such as insurance, super and investments;</li>
<li>Make a personal and business plan including a holiday as a reward;</li>
<li>Keep your body moving to some fitness program;</li>
<li>Consult an independent advisor to keep your finances on track;</li>
<li>Make time to think outside the box each week to ensure you are on the right path.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are not very specific but it is strange how many of the issues that we deal with from a legal perspective come down to a problem not addressed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Many times during expensive and arduous litigation clients have asked themselves “why didn’t we do something sooner?”</p>
<p>We hope to encourage clients to talk to us at the earliest opportunity so we can do a better job and achieve more valuable outcomes for them.</p>
<p>This year we are inviting our business clients to see us after hours when required and to collaborate with us in preparing a plan for their matter. This means time and money budgets as well as defined outcomes.</p>
<p>If we can save you money we will, but we try to make sure it is not short sighted. If we would not do it ourselves we will not recommend it.</p>
<p>This year we plan to improve our technology and research platforms, add another business to the group and to improve our systems and procedures to deliver more consistently great work. Back to the lists I think!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been providing feedback by our quick survey and please take the chance to have your say at the link below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apart from wishing everybody an early Merry Christmas and Prosperous New Year, we would like to take this opportunity to invite you to complete a short survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We think that it is more important than ever that we canvas your views on the types of services that you want and your attitude to risk and value. Even though we have a detailed knowledge in the law, it is the specific tailoring of your requirements within that framework that we really want to target. As an example, we have moved far more towards a fixed fee for a set list of deliverable items as a scope of work. This makes it easier for us to identify the limits of the instruction and for our clients to understand exactly what it is they can achieve as an outcome. Ask us about our fixed fee client agreement and please complete the below survey which should really only take about two minutes of your time. Note that the first four surveys will get a free bottle of French champagne as a bonus. Thanks very much, we look forward to the opportunity to act of your behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take the time to complete our survey below, we would love to hear from you</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The superannuation legislation and regulations continue to evolve as successive governments tinker with the frame works. It is critical in our view that the accountant, the superannuation advisor and a lawyer work openly and in conjunction to ensure that the interests of the client are protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fines for non-compliance have drastically increased and it is very clear that self-managed super funds are firmly in the line of fire for the tax office to review and audit. Given our experience we urge a high level of caution in any transaction to ensure that compliance is met and your rights are protected. This is even more so where clients are purchasing property in their SMSF using a bare trust arrangement for a component of borrowing. More often than not our role is restricted in effecting the property transfer, however it is far better to have a robust and open discussion prior to entering into the contractual documentation to ensure all aspects are covered. By reverse checklisting the auditors requirements prior to signing of documents, clients can better insulate themselves against a breach of regulation at a later time. Ask us how to run through that checklist of issues before you sign a property contract.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most significant changes we see are the duties of executors and administrators in relation to the estate assets, compared to the rights and obligations that apply to the superannuation entitlements. We are finding that this is a significant pressure point where clients have not made a clear binding death benefit nomination on their superannuation member benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save a great deal of heartache we strongly recommend that clients prepare and execute a detailed binding death benefit nomination, whether it is an industry superannuation fund of a Self-managed fund. Ask us how we can do this in conjunction with your overall estate plan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Most business owners will have heard of changes in respect of family trusts and perhaps the case of Bamford which resulted in the  2011 ‘trust streaming’ amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Acts. So what should you do?</em></p>
<p><b>To check if a trust deed should be varied?</b></p>
<p>The simplest test to check if a family discretionary trust deed should be updated by adding further wording is to look at the definition of <b>‘income of the trust fund’ or ‘net income’</b>. If your deed states that “income” means ‘section 95 net income’, or there is no definition stated regarding “income” , then your trust deed needs amending.</p>
<p>The ATO’s <a href="http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?Docid=DTR/TR2012D1/NAT/ATO/00001">draft taxation ruling (TR 2012/D1)</a> lists some of the serious problems that can arise if your deed does not define income properly. This will include the limitation to “stream” income to different beneficiaries in financial years and deal with franking credits on shares held by the trust to minimise tax.</p>
<p><strong>Unit trusts?</strong><b></b></p>
<p>If your unit trust receives franked dividends (tax has been paid) from distributions made by a trustee, the trust must be a ‘fixed’ trust in order to get the tax benefit.</p>
<p>If  a unit holder in the trust is a superannuation fund, there is a  real risk that money paid (distributions) from the unit trust to the superannuation fund will be taxed at a higher rate as ‘non-arm’s length income’. This was the situation in the recent case of <i>MH Ghali Superannuation Fund</i> ([2012] AATA 527).</p>
<p>If franked dividends are paid or a superannuation fund holds units the odds are the trust deed should be amended and updated in the wording, as very few unit trusts appear to qualify as “fixed trusts” under the tough provisions set out in the Tax Legislation.</p>
<p><b>What action to take?</b></p>
<p>We can read your trust deed and advise whether it is a discretionary trust, a unit trust or “hybrid” trust ( a blend of the two) to confirm if the wording must be updated. If the wording of a deed needs to be amended, we can draft the required Deed of Variation and Resolutions of the Trustee adopting the changes for a set amount.</p>
<p>It is particularly important that the trust deed is reviewed well before the end of the financial year so get cracking and <a title="Talk To Us" href="http://crillylaw.com.au/talk-to-us/">contact us</a> without delay!</p>
