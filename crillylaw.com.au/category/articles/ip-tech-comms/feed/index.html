				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us at some point know someone that has told us about illegally downloading a movie via an internet site. It seems unfair for those of us who pay full price through iTunes but most of us just figure that the younger generation are smarter than us.</p>
<p>A new Federal Court case sheds some light on the rights of the movie makers as owners of the copyright and those pesky downloaders. What happens when they get caught and how do they get caught?</p>
<p>It seems from the evidence in the Dallas Buyers Club Movie (DBC) and a group of Internet Service Providers (ISP), including IINet, Internode and Dodo, that the fight continues. On 14 August the Federal Court gave an indication of the compensation copyright owners can expect to claim in future copyright breach matters and how the illegal downloaders might expect to receive a bill.</p>
<p>What happened here was a digital investigator found 4,726 IP Addresses from which the DBC movie was illegally downloaded and shared on &#8220;Bit Torrent&#8221;. The owner sought a Court Order requiring the relevant ISP to provide details of the owners of the IP Addresses.</p>
<p>To get an Order like this they had to demonstrate a right to obtain relief against potential Defendants, namely the ISP account holders. The judge ordered the ISP to provide this information but DBC had to provide the letter of demand to the account holders. The concern here was an unreasonable demand for the level of damages suffered from the copyright infringement.</p>
<p>In terms of the amount of money the owner of the copyright intended to claim, the letters set out four things:-</p>
<ol>
<li>A claim for the cost of downloading a film;</li>
<li>A claim relating to the uploading or sharing of the film on Bit Torrent;</li>
<li>A claim relating to additional damages because of repeat infringing;</li>
<li>A claim for part of the costs of proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The general principle is that damages must put the party who has had their rights breached, in the same position it would have been in, had the infringement never occurred.</p>
<p>The judge found that a claim relating to the cost of downloading the film and a claim for a proportionate part of the cost of proceedings was permissible. However the Court found that a claim relating to the uploading or sharing of the film on Bit Torrent and additional damages due to potential repeat infringements was not.</p>
<p>I learnt that a user downloads slivers of a movie file from many other uses, and the slivers are then put together to form the full movie. By doing this Bit Torrent automatically shares and uploads the slivers of the file to each of the other downloaders. It must be a Gen Y thing!</p>
<p>The owners of the copyright claim that each sliver shared was actionable. This meant they would have been charged for sharing the film on the internet at full price for each sliver. The Court found this was not permissible even though it was clearly designed to act as a deterrent to the illegal downloading.</p>
<p>The Court also found additional damages could be claimed when taking into account all the other relevant matters including downloaders history on Bit Torrent so that the more they downloaded, the higher the additional damages should be. The Court found that this approach by the copyright owner was not reasonable and it came back to the cost of hiring the film by download and a proportionate part of the cost of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The Court said they would only allow access to the identities of the downloaders if DBC undertook to make a claim for the cost of download of the movie and proportionate part of the proceedings only. The Court required the foreign based owner of the copyright to pay a bond of $600,000.00 to the Court which would be lost if they failed to follow the undertakings. Heavy stuff!</p>
<p>So the general principles to be derived are:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal downloaders can be pursued by virtue of the ISP; and</li>
<li>Reasonable damages will be awarded as well as a proportionate part of the cost of the action of the breach, but no more.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tricky situation for an owner of a copyright is, will the costs of proceedings and pursuing the illegal downloaders and recovering small amount of damages be cost effective and enough of a deterrent. It certainly makes you think very carefully about how technology is disrupting the traditional framework of access to material, rights to exercise over the cost of sharing copyright material and whether any potential claims are adequate deterrent from doing it.</p>
<p>Owners of copyright of should think very carefully about how it is shared by the internet. Call us if you would like to discuss your copyright issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we talked about different methods of electronic signatures and why the process is important for binding agreements. This time we round off the discussion about how best to achieve the signing by law</p>
<p><strong>What are the obvious legal risks?</strong></p>
<p>There is a risk that the identity of the person using the private key is not accurate, or at least may be subject to a legal challenge. This would be similar to a situation where a handwritten signature is required and a person fraudulently signs the contract.</p>
<p>There is no practical way to verify the person&#8217;s identity with one hundred percent certainty using digital signature tools. Arguably the biggest failing with digital signatures and public-key cryptography generally, is that they are dependent on the <strong>private key being kept secret</strong>. If the private key is exposed, it is open for someone to dispute that they were indeed the person who &#8220;digitally signed&#8221; a document. If a targeted cyber-attack or data breach exposed a private key, then it would have a cascading effect on the enforceability of digitally signed documents which depend upon that key.</p>
<p>Accordingly, some may argue that this is also true for more traditional methods of signing, although there is certainly still a commonly held belief that wet ink signing trumps digital signatures in security – this is largely due to the fact that a wet ink signing can be witnessed and verified by another person also signing by a wet ink signing.</p>
<p>To help reduce this risk, there have been a number of additional verification and authentication techniques made available to users. Most digital signature software products incorporate a range of additional security measures into the signing process which can usually be configured by the user. These include the use of biometric authentication, chain of custody features, timestamps, and email and IP address tracking. Most importantly, software that generates digital signatures encourages the verification of the signor&#8217;s identity through a certification authority (<strong>CA</strong>). CAs are usually secure online databases that can be accessed by subscribed users. Here, users confirm their identity by providing certain information to the CA and are issued a digital signature certificate –or a unique ID – that is stored online. The recipient of the digital signature can then find a person&#8217;s digital signature certificate and compare the public key specified on it to the one they received, thus verifying the signor&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>To ensure the security of transactions, it is therefore encouraged that parties have both the digital signature and digital signature certificate systems in place. Also, it is imperative that private keys are not readily accessible on company databases and are instead held by the person named on the digital signature individually.</p>
<p>Another issue to be aware of is the software&#8217;s archiving capabilities. It is imperative that the digital signature software you choose has an effective archiving system which makes retrieving data as easy as possible. This becomes important when a dispute arises with regards to whether an agreement was signed months or years after the fact.</p>
<p>The sophistication of your contracts and the individuals signing of these contracts will have a large impact on whether you find these tools useful.</p>
<p>Practical problems arise when using digital signature products for smaller contracts such as employment contracts as they will not have a certified authentication.</p>
<p><strong>What about overseas?</strong></p>
<p>How frequently you have dealings with other countries may affect whether you decide to use digital signature technology to sign important documents. While the UN Electronic Communications Hague Convention dictates that electronic signatures are to be treated in the same way as handwritten signatures, not all countries have ratified the Convention. Some international agreements where parties are in a country that did not verify the Convention, will still require handwritten signatures before being satisfied that a transaction is valid.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that most companies developing and licensing this sort of software are based in the USA. While most premium products currently comply with Australian and international law, their main concern will be complying with USA law. The laws in the USA and Australia will develop differently and changes to local legislation may become an issue. There has been no definitive case law in Australia confirming the validity of digital signature software, although it is important to note that cases have been won in the USA based on evidence retained by premium digital signature software.</p>
<p><strong>Data retention and the Privacy Act</strong></p>
<p>Just when you thought it was easy, there may be information privacy laws and data ownership issues to consider. Where personal information is disclosed overseas, potentially this is in contravention of information privacy laws in the the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>Certain information collected in connection with the digital signature process might be “personal information”. This would mean that copies of the background data, auditing and archiving information, as well as the agreements themselves may be disclosed outside of Australia. Most products allow users to save any documents that are signed through electronic means locally, however if a cloud storage is being utilised there may be room to negotiate data jurisdiction with the provider of your choice to eliminate this risk.</p>
<p><strong>What are the conclusions?</strong></p>
<p>We should all be mindful of the need to prove the validity of a digital signature if challenged. The key is ensuring that you and the parties you deal with, will register digital signatures with a CA and have access to an effective auditing system. Ideally these features should be easy to subscribe to in conjunction with using your digital signature software. Most commercially available products have built-in auditing systems which are easily accessible to trace the progress of each digital signature. Ultimately, you will need to make sure that you are satisfied with both your verification practices and the other party&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Good digital signature products will have more than the bare essential verification and authentication features. A product that is constantly updated to reflect this progress is desirable. You should consider carefully the particular needs of your company, training of your employees, and compatibility with existing internal electronic infrastructure. This is no easy task but certainly worthwhile if it means you can enforce the Agreement and get paid and avoid unintended claims made by another party overseas.</p>
<p>Make sure you check the procedures you have adopted as well as the software and give us a call if you want a review of these procedures. In the end you do need the agreement to be binding and not open to challenge, especially if it represents a large amount of money for your business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a strange thing to find yourself increasingly challenged by the pace of change, and none greater than the impact of technology. People live in a very different way, than say 20 years ago, when I started this business, and the way we communicate with each other is fundamentally altered.</p>
<p>We are under real pressure to respond faster, process more efficiently and create a platform of client interaction that meets the “what’s in it for me” requirement.</p>
<p>We live in a smaller global community, events and the means to communicate have become easily accessible and barriers of distance and time zones have been removed. The way we conduct business transactions is also affected and the bridging of the international barrier has meant much of the mindset has fallen away. People see no issue with downloading agreements from different jurisdictions and using templates for negotiations in many different circumstances. This is regardless of the legal technicalities concerning enforcement if the deal goes bad and great caution should be exercised. Consider the types of transactions affected, the purchase of foreign goods or services on-line, a merger or takeover by a foreign company, property investments by non-Australian residents, contracts for Information Technology and multi-jurisdiction commodity agreements.  These are all regularly negotiated and confirmed using electronic documents and communications.</p>
<p>It is all very well to have documents downloaded, but how do parties effectively sign them? Are electronic signatures in fact legally binding, and can they be used as evidence in court?</p>
<p>The law of contracts formed through electronic means is a tricky area, so consider the following legal issues about electronic signatures.</p>
<p><strong>Main Points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under Australian and International law, electronic signatures are a valid way of executing agreements.</li>
<li>When evidence is required confirming the identity of the person signing <strong>and</strong> their intention to be bound by the content of contract, problems can arise.</li>
<li>Digital signature tools and authentication methods (such as public key cryptography) can reduce the risks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Electronic Signatures – A Difficult Proof?</strong></p>
<p><em>Electronic contracts </em></p>
<p>For a contract to be validly formed by law, certain conditions must be evidenced. These elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>an intention to create contractual relations;</li>
<li>acceptance of an offer; and</li>
<li>consideration (that is, a benefit in exchange for obligations by both parties such as a payment of deposit).</li>
</ul>
<p>In most commercial transactions, the formal signing of a valid agreement electronically, satisfies these elements under International and Australian law, and is treated like a paper contract.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual requirements for a paper contract, a contract formed electronically is legally valid if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the contract is <em>stored</em> appropriately and can be <em>accessed</em> after signing; and</li>
<li>there has been consent between the parties to receive information electronically, expressly or by implication.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that, by law, a person or company will be bound by a communication if it was sent by the person or company, or with their consent. This can create problems on the issue of evidence of intention to be bound, particularly in circumstances where parties to transactions are not dealing with each other face to face (without a witness present).</p>
<p><strong>What are Electronic signatures?</strong></p>
<p>An electronic signature can be defined as, <em>“a signature using software on an electronic document or transmission, either by an encryption method or a scanned version of handwritten signature”</em>. They are recognised under both International and Australian law as having the same effect as handwritten signatures, subject to the following qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>there must be consent by the recipient to receive information electronically;</li>
<li>the method of signing must identify the person sending the information, and indicate that this person approves of the content of the electronic document signed; and</li>
<li>the method of signing must be as reliable as is appropriate for the purposes for which the electronic document was generated, in all of the circumstances of the transaction.  Evidence of the identity of the signing party and that they approve the contents of the electronic document must be identified in the document. This reaffirms the need as to prove the identity of the person signing and their authority to do so (e.g. Director/Secretary of a company).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are new software programs available that enable a person with qualifications to verify the identity and signature of a person for real estate transactions. For the purposes of new electronic property transactions through PEXA a solicitor can scan a signature, identify the person with 100 points (like a bank) and certify they have done so for this system. This will then enable banks to rely on the signatures and the titles office that will ultimately register the documents for the transaction (such as a release of mortgage or caveat).</p>
<p>The difficulty in using an electronic signature becomes apparent when need to prove the identity of the signing person where the hand written signature isn&#8217;t witnessed by another person. Is it really theirs?</p>
<p>There is also the risk that the content of the document has been altered after being signed, as this can happen in any other traditional transaction signed by hand. Digital signatures have been introduced to try and minimise these risks.</p>
<p><strong>Digital signatures and public key cryptography</strong></p>
<p>A &#8220;digital signature&#8221; is a term used by some to describe a type of “electronic” signature. Digital signatures use technology that associates the scanned signature with hidden electronic data which can be used in an electronic document or communication. The main differences between an &#8220;electronic&#8221; and a &#8220;digital&#8221; signature is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>a digital signature is linked to certain information, and can be verified;</li>
<li>an electronic signature may just be text on an email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital signatures are therefore unique electronic &#8220;identities&#8221; which make them a more trusted and secure way of verifying the author of a document.</p>
<p>Many, if not all digital signatures rely on public key cryptography as their identity verification core – including popular products like Adobe EchoSign, and DocuSign. The basic premise behind this method is that a cryptographic private and public keys (being a randomly generated set of digits) are used for identity verification purposes.</p>
<p>The private key is only used by, and known to, the person associated with it. The related public key is shared publicly and visible by anyone else on the receiving end of the document containing the digital signature.</p>
<p>To create a digital signature, the private key is used to generate a unique code from a combination of the private key and the contents of the message. That code is embedded in the document and becomes the digital signature. Usually an image attached to the digital signature is calibrated as the visual aspect of the signature, such as an electronic copy of the signing person&#8217;s paper signature. This is not legally necessary, however the party receiving the document can then view the public key associated with the digital signature. There is typically no way for the recipient of the public key to discover the private key through this process.</p>
<p>The information that can be gained by having access to the public key is usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name linked to the digital signature; and</li>
<li>a verification that the contents of the documents have not been altered since inserting the digital signature to the document (by technical error or tampering).</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there is some complexity about the manner of applying an electronic signature. I will continue more on this next week so make sure you contact us if you need assistance with signing agreements.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is probably the area that has been of greatest interest to us this year. The notion of &#8220;digital assets&#8221; as part of a personal estate or business assets has become very significant. Most older documents do not deal with these specific rights, whether they be password access to key accounts, saving of data or documents or photos within the cloud, or the administration of those rights should a person die or become disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we think that is now more critical than ever for clients in their business to register and preserve their good will trading name by way of trade mark and domain name. given the substantial increase in online trading activity these assets take on far greater significance in the ultimate sale of a business as part of an exit strategy than ever before. Ask us how to quickly and easily register a trade mark in your circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of changes to technology, we all sign up far too easily to terms and conditions of use of software whether it is online or as a subscriber elsewhere. The full impact of accepting those terms and conditions really need to be understood in the context of a change in the business, particularly if there is the introduction of new stakeholders. Ask us how to review those terms and conditions and do a risk analyst of the security aspects of your data, as we see this is the key area of the future for business to identify and protect stock.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We note there has been a significant change to franchising regulations and legislation this year and we would urge all clients to avail themselves of a review of their documentation in that regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The privacy act and regulations are of major interest to those clients who have a turnover of $3million or more, or expect to do so in the near future. Given that most small to medium enterprises are driven by collection and management of data, it will be a bigger concern for business owners in the future. Ask us how we can assist you with an assessment of disclosure and authority under the privacy act to ensure that your business complies now and in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also urge clients to consider very carefully the commercial trading terms and conditions. This might be as varied as the services contract with customers or your end user license terms if you provide services online. We always urge clients to consider the warranty and liability clauses that might apply in the extent of which they are covered by insurance. It is certainly worth a one hour review to keep pace with changes in technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also urge clients to review their advertising and marketing procedures for their business to ensure that they comply with the competition and consumer legislation. Again it is often just a simple one hour review that can identify major issues that could be easily rectified by change in terms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crilly Lawyers is pleased to offer a new fixed-fee IP and Technology Audit service for businesses.</p>
<p>The importance of a businesses&#8217; intellectual property and technology assets is often overlooked, but can quite often be the most valuable asset the business owns. Unfortunately, these assets are often allowed to languish or slip through a businesses&#8217; fingers due to poor management or understanding of these assets. The unwary business can also find itself unwittingly in breach of laws or contracts; a particularly prominent risk given recent legal developments including amendments to intellectual property and privacy laws.</p>
<p>The IP &amp; Technology Audit is a high level review of all your intellectual property and technology issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>copyright, patents and designs;</li>
<li>registered and unregistered trade marks;</li>
<li>confidentiality and trade secrets;</li>
<li>intellectual property licenses and disputes;</li>
<li>software and technology licenses and contracts;</li>
<li>websites, social media and online activities; and</li>
<li>privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our solicitors will attend your offices for a day and review your existing intellectual property and technology arrangements. After our review, you will receive a report outlining all your current intellectual property rights and technology contracts and our recommendations on any issues that we may have identified. We have a number of solicitors qualified in science and technology and can identify niche concerns for your consideration with industry experience.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact <a title="Tony Crilly" href="http://crillylaw.com.au/our-people/tony-crilly/">Tony Crilly</a> at our office.</p>
