				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Juana Eastwood, Solicitor from the Commercial Department and Emma Riley, Trainee Legal Executive from the Private Client Department exhibited at the Mingle for Business Conference on Friday 13<sup>th</sup> September. The event was held at the Springfield Hotel, Halkyn and organised by Sandra Donoghue, the founder of Mingle for Business who has explained that “Conferences allow attendees to take on new ideas and approaches that can have a hugely positive effect on their business. Learning from others can make us more effective and efficient, better equipped to overcome challenges, and give us different perspectives.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very well attended event with many local businesses exhibiting. Those attending had the benefit of listening to some very knowledgeable and motivational keynote speakers such as Karen Warren, KW Inner Strength who spoke about ‘A positive mindset for business’ and Kate Morris-Bates, InsideOut Wellness who covered ways in which to ‘Support your team and yourself’. Juana and Emma took time to speak with the delegates and exhibitors who attended and answered any questions that they had. Quite a few of the delegates were just starting out in business so took the opportunity to discuss with Juana their individual circumstances and Juana was able to highlight some key considerations that they need to think about, such as Terms and Conditions, Contracts and Privacy Policies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act 2017 comes into effect today 31<sup>st</sup> July 2019. Also known as Claudia’s Law, it provides for the appointment of a person to take charge of a missing person’s finances while they are missing, to ensure that their affairs are dealt with appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until today, no -one had the power to do this, and this situation resulted in many lives being affected by the impact of a missing person. Claudia’s Law was enacted after Claudia’s father, Peter Lawrence, backed by the Charity Missing People, campaigned for this law to fill the gap which left a missing person’s affairs in abeyance for years. Claudia went missing in 2009, and despite police investigations, has never been found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a person is missing for over 90 days, the Court can now appoint a Guardian to protect their property and affairs and act in the missing person’s best interests. As Court of Protection Panel Deputies, and Court of Protection specialists, Solicitors at Swayne Johnson are used to acting in this role and can help families at this difficult time in their lives. Sarah Noton, Panel Deputy and Solicitor commented “Claudia’s Law is going to be incredibly useful to families who are already in considerable distress in these situations. It will enable the practical aspects of a disappearance to be managed with the authority of the Court, something which has not been available before now.”</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Information Commissioner’s Office (</span><b>ICO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) announced on 9 July 2019 an intention to issue a fine of £99,200,396 to hotel chain Marriott International (Marriott) for breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation (</span><b>GDPR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes just days after the announcement of the ICO’s intention to fine British Airways over £183.39m following a cyber attack, set to be the largest penalty yet.</span></p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marriott suffered a cyber-security incident, which was reported to the ICO in November 2018. A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally &#8211; 7 million UK guests &#8211; were affected by the incident. The ICO statement indicates that this incident may have been ongoing since 2014, when the systems of Starwood Hotels Group (acquired by Marriott in 2016) were compromised. Following notification of the incident, the ICO carried out an investigation and found that there was a failure by Marriott to conduct a sufficient due diligence exercise when it acquired Starwood back in 2016. </span></p>
<h2>What does this mean for you and your organisation?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent flurry of enforcement action from the ICO demonstrates the regulator’s serious attitude towards implementation of the GDPR. Following the anniversary of the introduction of the GDPR, it has become clear that the ICO will not be taking a lenient approach to non-compliance, particularly personal data breaches, and all organisations should be taking steps to protect their systems with appropriate security measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marriott enforcement action highlights that there is an increased emphasis on data protection compliance during the due diligence process of a sale and purchase of a business.  Before acquiring a business, it is essential to make appropriate enquiries, review its data security policies and practices and test for cyber security robustness. Appropriate warranties and indemnities from the sellers should be included in the acquisition contract as to the target business’ data protection and cyber security processes, procedures, and compliance in order to mitigate the purchaser’s exposure to risk of fines from the ICO and claims for compensation from affected data subjects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are thinking of selling your business, it would be most beneficial for you to identify the data processed and review the procedures that you have in place before you commence the sale process. We have the necessary expertise to assist you with this at Swayne Johnson Solicitors, as our Commercial team regularly deal with business sales and purchases and we have the specialist knowledge to provide expert advice on GDPR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buyer will want to obtain certain information, including but not limited to, the type of personal data processed, how the business collects and stores the data, whether appropriate records have been kept, whether a data protection officer has been appointed and whether there are any data processing agreements with third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to enquire about ways to prevent or deal with personal data breaches, or our corporate data protection due diligence services, please email or call one of Swayne Johnson Solicitors’ Data Protection specialists:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Information Commissioner’s Office (</span><b>ICO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) has issued a </span><a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/ico-announces-intention-to-fine-british-airways/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its intention to fine British Airways (</span><b>BA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) a record £183.39m for infringing the General Data Protection Regulation (</span><b>GDPR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) in June 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first intention of a fine to be issued by the ICO under the GDPR, and the proposed fine would be the largest fine ever imposed by the ICO</span><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fine relates to a cyber-security incident that took place via the BA website. Users of the BA website were diverted to a fraudulent site as a result of a hacking attack. Around 500,000 customers had their details compromised &#8211; including log in information, payment information and travel booking details. BA notified the ICO of the incident in September 2018. The ICO has since investigated the matter and found that the personal data breach occurred as a result of BA’s poor security arrangements</span><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The ICO has now proposed a fine of £183.39m, representing 1.5% of BA’s worldwide turnover in 2017 (against the possible maximum fine of 4% of turnover). The ICO will be considering the representations made by BA and the other concerned data protection authorities before it takes its final position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This incident serves as a reminder to all organisations of the importance of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">take the necessary steps to protect personal data against loss, damage or theft</span><b>. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although organisations cannot always defend themselves against malicious hacking attacks, it is important to be able to demonstrate that appropriate steps have been taken to protect personal data and that data breaches are handled appropriately, to mitigate the amount of the potential penalty following any ICO investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to discuss further or enquire about advice on how to prevent, protect against, and mitigate personal data breaches, please call one of Swayne Johnson Solicitors’ specialist Data Protection Team:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Swayne Johnson has the pleasure of supporting one of Wales’ oldest cricket clubs, Denbigh Cricket Club, which is celebrating its 175th anniversary this summer.</strong></p>
<p>Denbigh Cricket Club’s ancestry dates back to 1844 – ten years before Swayne Johnson began however, both of our local connections date back even earlier!</p>
<p>Research by the club and by former Swayne Johnson Managing Director Edward Lloyd, a former club captain himself, has revealed a connection with the famous cricketer Dr W G Grace.</p>
<p>Edward Lloyd, who recently retired this year, still closely supports the cricket club today. He goes on to say,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“There’s a very strong connection between Swayne Johnson and Denbigh Cricket Club with the two Colonel Swayne’s, E J and his son, Roderic, who were the successive presidents of the cricket club for 50 years from 1922.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“They are commemorated in the Swayne Trophy, a silver tankard, which goes to the clubman of the year and was presented to the club after the death of Colonel Roderic Swayne MC – he won the Military Cross in 1917 in Flanders &#8211; in 1972.</em></p>
<p>The Cricket Club will be marking the occasion with a Summer Ball on <strong>Saturday, June 8th</strong>, at the Club on Ystrad Road, Denbigh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Swayne Johnson team members attended the Law Society Annual Dinner which raised money in aid of a local charity.</strong></p>
<p>The event took place on 1st March.</p>
<p>The Cheshire and North Wales Law Society (CNWLS) is an association that works to help the interests of the legal profession in both the Cheshire and North Wales areas. Since their foundation in 1859, their primary role has been to represent, promote and engage with members of the legal profession regionally and nationally.</p>
<p>Even though the legal and professional landscape has changed to much over the years, the society too has evolved with the times and remained relevant to all of us in the profession.</p>
<p>The Annual Dinner is a prestigious event that brings all of us in the industry together for a night of celebrating the region’s thriving legal profession. It was attended by over 200 professionals from across North Wales and Cheshire.</p>
<p><strong>Christina Blacklaws, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales hosted the evening and £1,150 was raised for her chosen charity, MIND.</strong></p>
<p>The Trelawnyd Male Voice Choir provided the entertainment.</p>
<p>From the Swayne Johnson team, Rebecca Robinson, Ceinwen Jones, Shaun Hughes, Anna Lloyd Edwards, Mared Williams and Sioned Williams attended and proudly represented the company.<u></u><u></u></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that we are continuing our expansion across North Wales by opening our first branch on Anglesey. We have secured the Old Bank Building in Uxbridge Square at Menai Bridge, and we aim to open its doors as one of our solicitors offices in January 2019.</p>
<p>The Old Bank Building as our Anglesey Office offers us a high street presence in North West Wales, as well as being a welcome addition to our existing offices- which employ over 50 staff across North Wales to Cheshire. Our Menai Bridge office will be overseen by our Head of Residential Conveyancing and Director, <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/profile-listing/michael-tree-ll-b-hons-director-solicitor/">Michael Tree</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/profile-listing/sara-lloyd-evans/">Sara Lloyd Evans</a></strong>, one of our family law experts, <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/profile-listing/shaun-hughes/">Shaun Hughes</a></strong>, one of our private client experts who covers wealth management business succession planning, wills, trusts and probate, and trainee solicitor <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/profile-listing/ceinwen-jones/">Ceinwen Cet Jones</a></strong> will be based at Menai Bridge- offering our North West Wales clients a more accessible and a fully bilingual service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Managing Director- <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/profile-listing/sarah-noton-hons-t-e-p-director-solicitor/">Sarah Noton</a></strong> said:</p>
<p><em>“Menai Bridge is a gateway to the island, but still with easy access to Gwynedd and there is so much going on in this area with Wylfa Newydd, the investment in Coleg Menai, Llangefni, tourism and the growing restaurant scene. Property here is also doing well with North Wales’s most expensive postcode in Marianglas and other hotspots and of course it’s a major farming area too and </em><em>agriculture is an area where we have specialist expertise.”</em></p>
<p><em>“This makes our services more accessible and the response from the clients has been very positive. We also believe it is important to be able to offer a fully bilingual service, especially in this area and to offer real expertise as well so that clients don’t need to look to firms from outside the area for the legal skills they need.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarah also mentioned that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“We cover just about every aspect of the law and we have experts in most fields across the group which is very important in these increasingly complex times and in Sara and Shaun we have lawyers who know this area very well. The fact we now have offices right across North Wales and in Cheshire means we have strength and depth and a great geographic spread in relation to the area we cover. But at the same time a big part of what we do at Swayne Johnson is about relationships. Clients don’t want faceless people, they want someone who can help and reassure them and that’s what Sara and Shaun bring to their roles.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;We believe it is important for our customers to be secure in the knowledge they have expert legal help right on their doorstep without having to go to Liverpool, Manchester or further afield.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will keep you informed of the progress of the Menai Bridge Office, and we very much look forward to serving our clients in North West Wales in 2019 and beyond.</p>
