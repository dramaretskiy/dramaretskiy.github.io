				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swayne Johnson are supporting Dying Matters Week which this year takes place from 13th to 19th May.</p>
<p>Throughout North Wales and West Cheshire we provide legal advice on making a Will and assistance on probate following a death.  This brings us into regular contact with the subject of dying and gives us an understanding as to how difficult it can be for many people to discuss this topic.</p>
<p>The Dying Matters campaign seeks to promote public awareness of dying, death and bereavement so that these conversations might become a little easier.</p>
<p>One of the main events in North Wales will be on Friday 10th May at Llandudno Town Hall.  This is an open event from 10am to 3.30pm with stall holders offering advice and information, plenty of tea and cake and some entertainment from an Elvis impersonator.</p>
<p>The intention is that if it can be easier for us to talk about death then it’s more likely that our wishes will be known and followed.  This can lead to a better experience for the person dying and their family.</p>
<p>We’re conscious that as solicitors specialising in Wills and Probate we can have a positive impact on the death and bereavement process.  For example, at the same time as making a Will or Power of Attorney we can help our clients with end of life plans and Living Wills.  When dealing with probate, we focus on what steps we can take to relieve the pressure on the executors so, hopefully, giving them more space for grieving.</p>
<p>It takes all of us as a society to engage in this change of approach so that taking about death, dying and bereavement becomes a little easier.  That’s why events such as Dying Matters are so important.</p>
<p>We’re going to be one of the stall holders at the event in Llandudno Town Hall on 10th May and we’re bringing cake – we hope to see you there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most businesses process information about their customers, clients and employees. Therefore, GDPR will have an impact on the sale of the business.</p>
<p>The buyer will want to ensure that they find out as much information as possible about your business so that they are able to make an informed decision. Ordinarily you will receive a legal due diligence questionnaire via your solicitor which will need to be completed accurately. Due to the introduction of GDPR, there is expected to be an increased emphasis on data protection compliance. The buyer’s adviser will be looking closely at the answers provided to identify whether the business has been complying. It is very important that your business can demonstrate compliance, as the buyer’s adviser will be highlighting the sanctions which can be imposed for non-compliance to the prospective buyer.</p>
<p>It would be most beneficial for you to identify the data processed and review the procedures that you have in place before you commence the sale process. We have the necessary expertise to assist you with this at Swayne Johnson, as our Commercial team regularly deal with business sales and we have the specialist knowledge to provide advice on GDPR.</p>
<p>The buyer will want to obtain certain information including but not limited to, the type of personal data processed, how the business collects and stores the data, whether appropriate records have been kept, whether a data protection officer has been appointed and whether there are any data processing agreements with third parties.</p>
<p>If you are able to demonstrate that your business has carefully considered the relevant requirements of GDPR it will be a relief to a prospective buyer.</p>
<p>Having the insight into your business will then enable us to assist you with answering the due diligence questionnaire. We will be advising that the disclosure needs to be made in accordance with the lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle under the GDPR. It is highly likely that you will need to redact or anonymise personal data before providing it to the buyer. For example, information relating to employees and individual customers/clients and suppliers.</p>
<p>It is also anticipated that there will be more focus on the negotiations in respect of the data protection warranties, especially if the due diligence reveals that there are potential data protection liabilities. We are able to offer the necessary advice and provide you with an explanation in respect of your specific circumstances.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are looking to purchase a business (asset purchase), it is quite possible that you are wondering how the process works.  We regularly assist clients with buying businesses which can range from hotels, salons, tea rooms and retail shops. The main steps of the transaction are outlined below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Preliminary Agreements</li>
</ol>
<p>In some circumstances the parties enter into a confidentiality agreement before they receive any information of a confidential nature and/or an exclusivity agreement to agree a set period of exclusivity.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Heads of Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>We are normally provided with Heads of Terms from the acting agent (if there is one). Alternatively, some clients have negotiated directly, and we are provided with key terms which have been agreed between the parties. This provides us with an overview of the transaction and helps us provide you with a clear indication of the legal costs involved. Wherever possible we try to provide a fixed fee quote at the outset of the matter.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Tax considerations</li>
</ol>
<p>An asset sale typically consists of numerous assets such as property, stock, plant, machinery and goodwill. The purchase price is apportioned, and it is important to work closely with the accountants to agree the apportionment due to the various tax implications.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Due diligence</li>
</ol>
<p>You as the buyer will want to ensure that you find out as much about the business as possible. We assist you with this by preparing a legal due diligence questionnaire covering issues such as property, data protection, employment and pensions. This questionnaire is then completed by the seller and the relevant advisers. If there is property included, we will conduct the usual searches and enquiries in respect of the property that we would ordinarily carry out in a conveyancing transaction.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Employees</li>
</ol>
<p>We will be identifying whether TUPE 2006 (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, SI 2006/246) applies and advising on the obligations under TUPE 2006. Generally speaking TUPE 2006 means that all employees automatically transfer to the transferee together with their contracts of employment.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The Asset Purchase Agreement</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the formal written agreement which will be entered into by the parties covering all aspects of the purchase of the business, including the parties, the assets, the property, conditions to completion, employees, liabilities, debts, warranties, limitations and restrictions on the seller. This will be bespoke and will be negotiated between the solicitors acting and amended accordingly.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Disclosure</li>
</ol>
<p>The seller’s solicitor will prepare a disclosure letter. This will usually include specific disclosures (for example if the seller is aware of something such as an employment law claim).</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Completion matters</li>
</ol>
<p>Formally completing the purchase, completion of any assignments or transfers and any necessary consents. The funds are transferred via the solicitors.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Post completion</li>
</ol>
<p>Dealing with the payment of stamp duty land tax and filing returns. The application to the Land Registry to register the buyer’s title to the property. Serving notices of assignment, underletting and charges to the landlord (as appropriate).</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Living Will” is the old term for what is now referred to as an “Advanced Decision”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" target="new" rel="nofollow">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> (which came into force in 2007) ensured Advanced Decisions now have legally binding status. Living Wills prepared prior to 2007 remain non-binding unless they have been updated or re-signed since 2007.</p>
<p>An Advanced Decision sets out a person’s wishes surrounding the refusal of future medical treatment. Thus, if they:</p>
<p>(a) lost mental capacity and were<br />
(b) unable to communicate their wishes regarding treatment refusal AND<br />
(c) they were in such a medical state that there was no prospect of recovering past artificial living, permanent medical intervention or resuscitation,</p>
<p>then medics must respect the treatment refusals set out in the Advanced Decision. Even if the withdrawal results in that person’s death e.g. if in a coma with no prospect of recovery other than to remain in that coma with the assistance of life support.</p>
<p>An Advanced Decision can also set out treatments a person wished to accept in future; but medics cannot be bound to administer treatment and so that element of the Advanced Decision would remain non-enforceable.</p>
<p>Crucially, the fact an Advanced Decision is now legally binding means medics/hospitals can be prosecuted if they fail to comply with its terms. That means it is now more important than ever to ensure the Advanced Decision is carefully and professionally drafted. Any ambiguity could result in that aspect of the Advanced Decision failing or at the very least, would provide a legitimate defence to it not being followed.</p>
<p>Medics could however, be bound to accept and administer treatments under a Health and Welfare Lasting <a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/personal-services/power-of-attorney/">Power of Attorney</a>, which, once registered, is a document that enables another person to make medical decisions as if it were the patient; but only at a time when the patient can no longer make decisions for themselves. So, if a person didn’t have specific or strong enough wishes to set out treatment refusals early, they could prepare a Health &amp; Welfare Lasting Power of Attorney and provide Attorneys with the flexibility to make and refuse treatment on their behalf in future, depending on prevailing circumstances at the time.</p>
<p>Such decisions under a Health &amp; Welfare Lasting Power of Attorney could even extend to who is allowed to visit the patient; their diet; their dress; their ongoing medication etc. Where a person has both an Advanced Decision and a Health &amp; Welfare Power of Attorney in place, priority is given to the document signed/registered second.</p>
<p>If you have prepared both documents in the past and are not sure which document may take priority, it could be worthwhile to <a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/contact-us/">seek professional opinion</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Landmark Judgment was published on 30 July 2018 relating to provision of food and liquid to patients in a persistent vegetative state.</p>
<p>The case was heard at the end of February 2018 in the Supreme Court. It related to an active man in his fifties called Mr Y by the Court who, in June 2017 had a heart attack. As a result he was left in a persistent vegetative state with Doctors advising there was no prospect of his condition improving.</p>
<p>Mr Y’s wife and children felt that he would not wish to be kept alive in these circumstances when he was receiving nutrition and liquid through feeding tubes. His Doctor’s advised that if these were removed his death would follow within two to three weeks.</p>
<p>An application was made to the Court of Protection for permission to withdraw food and drink. Mr Y passed away before the Court proceedings were concluded but the case continued as the Court felt the issue was of much wider public importance.</p>
<p>The Judges in the Supreme Court thoroughly examined the law about withdrawal of medical treatment and decided that nothing under the current UK law or European Regulations means that Court authority is required.</p>
<p>Applying to the <a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/personal-services/court-of-protection/"><strong>Court of Protection</strong></a> has historically been costly and time consuming and this can also leave to prolonged suffering for a patient. The decision has now been left to the patient’s doctors and family. However, are these people best placed to decide what the patient may have wanted?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/profile-listing/sian-thompson/"><strong>Sian Thompson</strong></a>, Solicitor at Swayne Johnson says-  <em>“rather than leaving this in the hands of the Doctors, it may have been better to establish a cost effective and streamlined process for an independent decision.”</em></p>
<p>One of the difficulties in Mr Y’s case and so many others in similar circumstances was that he had left no instructions or indication of his own views.</p>
<p>That situation is avoided by setting up an Advance Decision also known as a <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/personal-services/wills-trusts-estates/">Living Will</a></strong>. This is a legal document directing medical treatment and other care. It can be very detailed but at its most basic includes directions regarding resuscitation and life sustaining treatment.</p>
<p>Sian continues, <em>“Over the years I have prepared numerous Living Wills and no one has ever felt that food and drink should be withdrawn. Instead, when requesting that life sustaining treatment is withdrawn, the client asks that palliative care and nutrition be maintained so that they are kept as comfortable and free from pain as possible. The recent decision in the Supreme Court casts doubt on how hospitals will now approach these issues. I hope this will highlight the importance of considering these difficult subjects and sett</em><em>ing up a Living Will before the worst happens.”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the Welsh and English Schools getting ready to close for the six week summer holiday break, many families will be travelling abroad. Most parents who have been abroad with children would agree that entertaining them at the departure lounges can be slightly tricky, however for those parents who do not have the same surname as their children, it can be a lot more complicated.</p>
<p>More women are affected by this issue than men. Some may be divorced from their child’s father and may have remarried and taken on a new name. Others are married but have chosen not to take their husband’s surname whilst their children do. Of course there are also more and more unmarried couples who have children.</p>
<p>If you have a different surname to that of your child you need to be prepared in order to avoid unnecessary stress at the departure gates!</p>
<p>Whilst these checks are in place at airports, ports and international railway stations to protect our children and to prevent children from being kidnapped, we have also heard of families missing flights as a result of these checks. Such a situation can be avoided by ensuring that you are carrying the right documentation with you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Child’s Birth Certificate &#8211;</strong> this of course will state the name of your child, date and place of birth and will match the details on the passport. It will also provide the full names of both of parents at the time of the child’s birth. Therefore if your name has changed since your child was born, you will need to take even more documentation with you.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of your change of name –</strong> your marriage certificate or a change of name deed. Some travellers go as far as carrying expired passports in the name that they held at the time of the child’s birth and have found this to be useful. This would then allow the Border Official to link the Birth Certificate, Marriage Certificate and the expired and current passports!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are travelling alone without the child’s father, it would be advisable to ensure that you have the father’s consent to take the child abroad. <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/profile-listing/sara-lloyd-evans/">Sara Lloyd Evans</a></strong> one of our Family Solicitors would recommend that you ask the other parent to sign a consent form or a letter setting out their consent for the trip. The other parent’s full contact details should be included together with the full details of the trip (dates/destination/address). Of course each country has its own specific requirements for children travelling without one or more of their parents and therefore it would be advisable to check with the Home Office beforehand.</p>
<p>Travelling with children is stressful enough. You can hopefully avoid further complications by being prepared and ensuring that your travel wallet contains all necessary and relevant documents.</p>
<p>Bon Voyage!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the school holidays fast approaching, many parents will be planning activities for their children or holidays abroad. <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/personal-services/family/">Separated parents</a></strong> may find themselves upset or resentful if they have been denied the opportunity to spend quality time with their children over the next 6 weeks or even throughout the year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dress; church; venue; suits; flowers; invitations….. the list seems endless.  All of these things are important and will help make your day the best of your life! However, also on that list should be whether you have put formal affairs in order; such as <a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/personal-services/wills-trusts-estates/">making a Will</a>.</p>
<p>Statistics suggest that two thirds of the UK adult population have no Will, despite the fact that more than three quarters of adults plan on leaving money to their loved ones.</p>
<p>Many of those planning on leaving money to loved ones believe that the money will automatically go the people they wish, but unfortunately that is not the case.</p>
<p>To ensure that your assets go to the people you wish you are advised to make a Will.</p>
<p>Without a Will, your assets will pass in accordance with the rules of intestacy – complex rules that dictate which family members can inherit.  Even though there have been some recent changes to these rules; alarmingly, if you are not married to your partner, they will not automatically inherit <strong>any</strong> of your assets. A relative that you do not like, or have never met, could inherit your assets instead.</p>
<p>Making a Will also gives you the opportunity to make provision for who should look after your children and pets, state your funeral wishes and make individual specific gifts to friends and charities.  It also gives you the opportunity to ensure that your estate is looked after by those you trust, by specifying an Executor.</p>
<p>In short, to ensure that your assets are looked after by the person you would choose and are distributed to those you should make a Will.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is vital to ensure that your Will is as watertight as possible and that it is legally valid.  You are therefore advised to visit a solicitor to ensure that it is prepared and executed in the correct manner.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to reduce any heartache and hassle for loved ones after your death, please contact Rebecca Robinson …</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new scheme has been launched to refund those who may have paid more than they should for applying to register Powers of Attorney. The scheme is being administered by the <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian" target="new" rel="nofollow">Office of the Public Guardian</a></strong> (OPG) being the government body that monitor Attorneys and Deputies.</p>
<p>If you applied to register a <strong><a href="https://www.swaynejohnson.com/personal-services/power-of-attorney-2/">Lasting Power of Attorney</a></strong> (LPA) or Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) with the OPG between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2017 and paid an application fee, then you could be due a partial refund. The scheme will run for 3 years.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because the OPG&#8217;s processing costs have been reducing in recent years. This lead to the Ministry of Justice lowering the application fee in April 2013 from £130.00 to £110.00, and again in 2017 from £110.00 to £82.00 per registration. The refund scheme allows those who paid a higher fee when costs were reducing to claim a partial refund, as the Government is not allowed to make any form of profit from the service that they offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the refund scheme works</strong></p>
<p>If you, or someone you are acting for, thinks they may be eligible for a refund visit the <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney-refund" target="new" rel="nofollow">Government&#8217;s Refund Service</a></strong> for more details and make a claim using the online service. Only the person that made the LPA or EPA (the &#8216;Donor&#8217;), their Attorney or Deputy, or Personal representative can apply for the refund. Only the person that made the LPA or EPA, or their Personal Representative if they have since died, can receive the funds. Deputies and Personal Representatives should call the helpline below.</p>
<p>Only one application is needed per Donor, as the OPG&#8217;s computer system will pick up all the refunds due to the person from the details provided. Interest will be applied to the refund at a rate of 0.5% from the date that the original registration fee was paid.</p>
<p>We may have prepared and registered the Powers of Attorney on your behalf, and you might think that we could reclaim the refund on your behalf, however, it is very unlikely that this will be cost effective due to the relatively small amounts of money involved. The application process has been designed to be as easy to use as possible. Basic information about the Donor, such as their name, address, date of birth, name and date of birth of at least one attorney, and the Donor&#8217;s bank details will be needed to complete the application.</p>
<p>The process is likely to take around 12 weeks from start to end.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have internet access, or find dealing with issues online difficult, please contact the refund helpline by calling the OPG on 0300 456 0300 and selecting option 6.</p>
<p>This scheme is being administered by the OPG.</p>
<p>Lines are open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and<br />
Friday from 9am to 5pm and Wednesday from 10am to 5pm. <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/call-charges" target="new" rel="nofollow">Learn more about call charges</a></strong>.</p>
